Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.

　　Small increases in temperature found to add power to storms in the Atlantic.

　　Hurricanes that form in the Atlantic Ocean are expected to gain considerable strength asthe global temperature continues to rise, a new study has found.

　　Using modeling data focused on the conditions in which hurricanes form, a group ofinternational researchers based at Beijing Normal University found that for every 1.8°F ( 1℃ )rise of the Earth's temperature, the number of hurricanes in the Atlantic that are as strong orstronger than Hurricane Katrina will increase twofold to sevenfold.

　　Hurricane strength is directly related to the heat of the water where the storm forms. Morewater vapor in the air from evaporating ocean water adds fuel to hurricanes that build strengthand head toward land.

　　Hurricane Katrina is widely considered the measure for a destructive storm, holding themaximum Category 5 designation for a full 24 hours in late August 2005. It lost strength as itpassed over the Florida peninsula, but gained destructive power fight before colliding withNew Orleans, killing more than 200 people and causing $ 80 billion in damage.

　　The study points to a gradual increase of Katrina-like events. The warming experiencedover the 20th century doubled the number of such debilitating(将人类摧垮的)storms. But theongoing warming of the planet into the 21st century could increase the frequency of theworst kinds of storms by 700 percent, threatening coastlines along the Atlantic Ocean withmuitiple Category 5 storms every year.

　　"Our results support the idea that changes in regional sea surface temperatures is theprimary cause of hurricane variability," said Aslak Girnstead, a researcher with the Center forIce and Climate at the University of Copenhagen. The large impact of small sea-surfacetemperature increases was more than Girustead and his colleagues had anticipated. Theentire study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

　　Global temperatures have steadily increased, making the past decade the warmest onrecord. Earlier this year, climate researchers reported that the Earth's temperatures have risenfaster in the last century than at any point since the last ice age, 11,300 years ago. Theprimary cause, a couseusus of scientists has said, is the rising emissions of greenhousegases like carbon dioxide and methane.

　　Past hurricanes have supported the study's finding that global temperature rise is linkedto more destructive storms. According to the National Center for Atmospheric Research, whilethe frequency of storms doesn't appear to have increased, the percentage of strong ones hasrisen sharply over the past few decades. The trend may be similar further back in time, butcomprehensive hurricane data doesn't exist.

　　61. According to the team of international researchers based at Beijing Normal University,the rise of the Earth's temperature is likely to cause

　　A.the coming of ice age

　　C.more Katrina-like or worse hurricanes

　　B.less intense hurricanes

　　D.more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere

　　62. The ocean water in the region where the storm forms

　　A.is heating the hurricanes

　　B.evaporates and becomes fuel

　　C.heads toward land

　　D.turns into water vapor that makes hurricanes stronger

　　63. Which of the following statement is TRUE about Hurricane Katrina?

　　A.It did not lose its strength as it moved.

　　B.It claimed over 200 people's lives.

　　C.It caused 80 billion dollars loss for Florida peninsula.

　　D.It lasted for full 24 hours.

　　64. What result can regional sea surface temperature changes produce?

　　A.Hurricane changes.

　　C.Global warming.

　　B.Increasing greenhouse gas emissions.

　　D.Destructive hurricanes.

　　65. It can be inferred from the passage that

　　A.there is no link between greenhouse gas emissions and destructive storms

　　B.reduction of greenhouse gas emissions may reduce destructive storms

　　C.the higher percentage of strong ones rose as more hurricanes appeared

　　D.past records on hurricanes included everything needed

　　参考答案

　　61.C)。本题考查地球温度上升带来的变化。定位句提到“地球温度每上升l.8华氏度(1摄 氏度)，那么大西洋中强度可匹敌甚至胜过卡特里娜飓风的飓风数量会增加两倍乃至七倍”，故C)“更多像卡 特里娜那样或是更糟糕的飓风”为答案。

　　65.B)。由倒数第二段最后一句和最后一段的第一句可知，全球变暖是由温室气体大量排放引起的，而全球变暖和破坏性风暴频率变高之间存在联系，由此可推知，减少温室气体排放，或可缓解全球变暖的趋势，从而减少破坏性风暴的发生频率，故答案为B)。

Questions 56 to 60 are based on the followingpassage.

　　They're still kids, and although there's a lot thatthe experts don't yet know about them, one thingthey do agree on is that what kids use and expectfrom their world has changed rapidly. And it's allbecause of technology.

　　To the psychologists, sociologists, and generational and media experts who study them,their digital gear sets this new group apart, even from their tech-savvy (懂技术的) Millennialelders. They want to be constantly connected and available in a way even their older siblingsdon't quite get. These differences may appear slight, but they signal an all-encompassingsensibility that some say marks the dawning of a new generation.

　　The contrast between Millennials and this younger group was so evident to psychologistLarry Rosen of California State University that he has declared the birth of a new generation in anew book, Rewired: Understanding the ingeneration and the Way They Learn, out next month.Rosen says the tech-dominated life experience of those born since the early 1990s is sodifferent from the Millennials he wrote about in his 2007 book, Me, MySpace and I: Parenting theNet Generation, that they warrant the distinction of a new generation, which he has dubbedthe "ingeneration".

　　"The technology is the easiest way to see it, but it's also a mind-set, and the mind-set goeswith the little ‘i', which I'm talking to stand for 'individualized'," Rosen says. "Everything isdefined and individualized to ‘me'. My music choices are defined to ' me'. What I watch onTV any instant is defined to ‘me'. " He says the iGeneration includes today's teens and middle-school ers, but it's too soon to tell about elementary-school ages and younger.

　　Rosen says the iGeneration believes anything is possible. "If they can think of it, somebodyprobably has or will invent it," he says. "They expect innovation."

　　They have high expectations that whatever they want or can use "will be able to be tailoredto their own needs and wishes and desires."

　　Rosen says portability is key. They are inseparable from their wireless devices, which allowthem to text as well as talk, so they can be constantly connected-even in class, where cellphones are supposedly banned.

　　Many researchers are trying t6 determine whether technology somehow causes the brainsof young people to be wired differently. "They should be distracted and should perform morepoorly than they do," Rosen says. "But findings show teens survive distractions much betterthan we would predict by their age and their brain development. "

　　Because these kids are more immersed and at younger ages, Rosen says, the educationalsystem has to change significantly.

　　"The growth curve on the use of technology with children is exponential(指数的), and werun the risk of being out of step with this generation as far as how they learn and how theythink," Rosen says.

　　"We have to give them options because they want their world individualized. "

　　56. Compared with their Millennial elders, the iGeneration kids

　　A.communicate with others by high-tech methods continually

　　B.prefer to live a virtual life than a real one

　　C.are equipped with more modem digital techniques

　　D.know more on technology than their elders

　　57. Why did Larry Rosen name the new generation as iGeneration?

　　A.Because this generation is featured by the use of personal high-tech devices.

　　B.Because this generation stresses on an individualized style of life.

　　C.Because it is the author himself who has discovered the new generation.

　　D.Because it's a mind-set generation instead of an age-set one.

　　58. Which of the following is true about the iGeneration according to Rosen?

　　A.This generation is crazy about inventing and creating new things.

　　B.Everything must be adapted to the peculiar need of the generation.

　　C.This generation catches up with the development of technology.

　　D.High-tech such as wireless devices goes with the generation.

　　59. Rosen's findings suggest that technology

　　A.has an obvious effect on the function of iGeneration's brain development

　　B.has greatly affected the iGeneration's behaviors and academic performance

　　C.has no significantly negative effect on iGeneration's mental and intellectualdevelopment

　　D.has caused distraction problems on iGeneration which affect their daily performance

　　60. According to the passage, education has to __

　　A.adapt its system to the need of the new generation

　　B.use more technologies to cater for the iGeneration

　　C.risk its system to certain extent for the iGeneration

　　D.be conducted online for iGeneration's individualized need

　　参考答案

　　56.A)。本题考查“自我的一代” “千禧年一代”的区别。由定位句可知，“自我的一代”与他们的千禧年一代的哥哥姐姐们相比，更愿意持续不断地与他人保持联系，也希望随时能让别人找得到他们。由此可推断，他们愿意通过高科技手段与他人随时保持联系，因此A)是本题答案。

　　57.B)。本题考查罗森将新的一代命名为“自我的一代”的原因。该段前两句引述拉里罗森介绍“自我的一代”的话，点明了这代人的特点，即高科技是这代人的典型特征，它也是种心态，这种心态随 “小我”而变化，即“个性化”也是鲜明特点，表现为每件事都为“我”而定制，或每件事都被赋予个性化特征。 由此可见，这代人强调个性化的生活，因此B)是本题答案。

　　58.D)。本题考查关于“自我的一代”的论述哪项是正确的。由该段可知，对这代人而言，便携是关键。他们离不开无线装备，那些东西可使他们发短信或聊天，可以时刻与他人保持联系。由此可见。这一代人离不开无线高科技产品，因此D)是本题答案。

　　59.C)。本题考查科技对“自我的一代”的影响。由定位句可知，他们本来应该受到干扰，表现应该糟糕.但研究结果表明这些十来岁的孩子比我们通过年龄和大脑发育而做出的预测要有更强的抗干扰能力。由此可推断，科技并没有对他们的心智发展产生明显的负面影响，因此C)是本题答案。

　　60.A)。由该段可知，由于这代孩子在年幼时便深浸于科技之中，那么教育制度也要随之进行 显著改变。由此可推断，教育制度也应适应这代人，因此A)是本题答案。

　　Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.

　　Many bankers may be worried about whether some fancy product dreamed up might yetlead to a visit from the police. Daniel Dantas, a financier, who has profited by operating at themiddle place where business and government meet in Brazil, has been opening the door to findthe police outside for much of the

　　past decade. On December 2nd he was convicted of a less sophisticated crime: trying tobribe police officers. Mr. Dantas, who has acquired great notoriety in Brazil, was fined $ 5million and sentenced to ten years in prison. He has appealed against his conviction.

　　The charge stems from a police investigation into money-laundering (洗钱)known asOperation Satiagraha. It grew out of a previous investigation into Mr. Dantas' use of Kroll, asecurity consultancy, to watch over his business partners. During this investigation the policeseized a computer from Opportunity, Mr. Dantas's investment bank, which contained datafrom the mid-1990s to 2004 and apparently showed suspicious movements of money.

Questions 56 to 60 are based on the followingpassage.

　　Terry Wolfisch Cole may seem like an ordinary40-year-old mom, but her neighbors know the truth:She's one of the "Pod People." At the supermarketshe wanders the aisles in a self-contained bubble,thanks to her iPod digital music player. Through those little white ear buds, Wolfisch Cole listensto a playlist mixed by her favorite disc presenter-herself.

　　At home, when the kids are tucked away, Wolfisch Cole often escapes to another solomedia pod- but in this one, she's transmitting instead of just receiving. On her computer weblog, or "blog", she types an online journal chronicling daily news of her life, then shares it allwith the Web.

　　Wolfisch Cole-who also gets her daily news customized off the Internet and whose digitalvideo recorder (DVR)scans through the television wasteland to find and record shows that suither tastes-is part of a new breed of people who are filtering, shaping and even creating mediafor themselves. They are increasingly turning their backs on the established system of massmedia that has provided news and entertainment for the past half-century. They've joined theexploding "iMedia" revolution, putting the power of media in the hands of ordinary people.

　　The tools of the movement consist of a bubbling stew of new technologies that includeiPods, blogs, podcasts, DVRs, customized online newspapers, and satellite radio.

　　Devotees of iMedia run the gamut (范围)from the 89-year-old New York grandmother,known as Bubby, who has taken up blogging to share her worldly advice, to 11-year-old DylanVerdi of Texas, who has started broadcasting her own homemade TV show or "vlog', for videoweb log. In between are countless iMedia enthusiasts like Rogier van Bakel, 44, of Maine, whoblogs at night, reads a Web- customized news page in the morning, travels with his fully loadediPod and comes home to watch whatever the DVR has chosen for him.

　　If the old media model was broadcasting, this new phenomenon might" be called ego-casting, says Christine Rosen, a fellow with the Ethics and Public Policy Center. The term fits,she says, because the trend is all about me-me-media -" the idea is to get exactly what youwant, when and where you want it."

　　Rosen and others trace the beginnings of the iMedia revolution to the invention of the TVremote, which marked the first subtle shift of media control away from broadcasters and intothe hands of the average couch potato. It enabled viewers to vote with their thumbs-making iteasier to abandon dull programs and avoid commercials. With the proliferation (激增)of cableTV channels in the late 1980s followed by the mid-1990s arrival of the Internet, controllingmedia input wasn't just a luxury. "Control has become a necessity," says Bill Rose, "Withoutit, there's no way to sort through all the options that are becoming available."

　　56. Who is Terry Wolfisch Cole probably according to the passage?

　　A.A middle-aged housewife.

　　B.A saleswoman in the supermarket.

　　C.A disc presenter.

　　D.An online news writer.

　　57. Which of the following is the characteristic of the new breed of people according to thepassage ?

　　B.They have started the iMedia revolution.

　　C.They have helped ordinary people control media.

Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.

　　It would be all too easy to say that Facebook's market meltdown is coming to an end. Afterall, Mark Zuckerberg's social network burned as much as $ 50 billion of shareholders' wealth injust a couple months. To put that in context, since its debut(初次登台) on NASDAQ in May,Facebook has lost value nearly equal to Yahoo, AOL, Zynga, Yelp, Pandora, OpenTable,Groupon, LinkedIn, and Angie's List combined, plus that of the bulk of the publicly tradednewspaper industry:

　　As shocking as this utter failure may be to the nearly 1 billion faithful Facebook usersaround the world, it's no surprise to anyone who read the initial public offering (IPO)prospectus (首次公开募股说明书). Worse still, all the crises that emerged when the companydebuted-overpriced shares, poor corporate governance, huge challenges to the core business,and a damaged brand-remain today. Facebook looks like a prime example of what Wall Streetcalls a falling knife-that is, one that can cost investors their fingers if they try to catch it.

　　Start with the valuation(估值). To justify a stock price close to the lower end of theprojected range in the IPO, say $ 28 a share, Facebook's future growth would have needed tomatch that of Google seven years earlier. That would have required increasing revenue by some80 percent annually and maintaining high profit margins all the while.

　　That's not happening. In the first half of 2012, Facebook reported revenue of $ 2.24 billion, up38 percent from the same period in 2011. At the same time, the company's costs surged to $ 2.6 billion in the six-month period.

　　This so-so performance reflects the Achilles' heel of Facebook's business model, which thecompany clearly stated in a list of risk factors associated with its IPO: it hasn't yet figured outhow to advertise effectively on mobile devices, The number of Facebook users accessing thesite on their phones surged by67 percent to 543 million in the last quarter, or more than half itscustomer base.

　　Numbers are only part of the problem. The mounting pile of failure creates a negativefeedback loop that threatens Facebook's future in other ways. Indeed, the more Facebook'sdisappointment in the market is catalogued, the worse Facebook's image becomes. Not onlydoes that threaten to rub off on users, it's bad for recruitment and retention of talentedhackers, who are the lifeblood of Zuckerberg's creation.

　　Yet the brilliant CEO can ignore the sadness and complaints of his shareholders thanks tothe super- voting stock he holds. This arrangement also was fully disclosed at the time of theoffering. It's a pity so few investors apparently bothered to do their homework.

　　61. What can be inferred about Facebook from the first paragraph?

　　A.Its market meltdown has been easily halted.

　　B.It has increased trade with the newspaper industry.

　　C.It has encountered utter failure since its stock debut.

　　D.Its shareholders have invested $ 50 billion in a social network.

　　62. The crises Facebook is facing_____

　　B.cooperate with Google

　　C.keep enormously profitable

　　D.invest additional $ 2.6 billion

　　64. It can be inferred from the context that the "Achilles' heel" (Line 1, Para. 5) refersto____

　　A.deadly weakness

　　B.problem unsolved

　　C.indisputable fact

　　D.potential risk

　　65. What effect will Facebook's failure in the market have?

　　A.Its users' benefits will be threatened.

　　B.Talented hackers will take down the website.

　　C.The CEO will hold the super-voting stock.

　　D.The company's innovation strength will be damaged.

　　参考答案

　　62.D)。事实细节题。D)‘‘已经存在很长时间了”，与定位句中remain today的意思相同，故为答案。

　　63.C)。本题考查脸谱网如何才能使其制定的股价合理，题干中的reasonable对应原文中的justify。定位句提到，要实现接近其公开募股说明书上的较低股价，比如每股28美元，这就要求脸谱网年收益增长要高达80%，并始终保持高利润率，故答案为c)。

　　64.A)。本段提到，脸谱网现在还未解决如何有效地在移动设备上做广告这一问题，而用手机登录其网站的用户数量却不断飙升，且文章通篇语义色彩都是消极的，故可推出此处应指脸谱网商业模式中的致命软肋，故答案为A)。

　　65.D)。由定位句可知，脸谱网在市场上的失意不仅会影响到用户，还会影响招募和挽留天才 黑客，而这些人正是扎克伯格创造力的命脉。由此推知，脸谱网的创新力会因其市场失意而受到损害，故答案为D)。

Questions 56 to 60 are based on the followingpassage.

　　There is a certain inevitability that ebook saleshave now overtaken paperback sales on Amazon'sUS site. Amazon's Kindle 2 is so light and so cheapthat it's easy to see why people have rushed to buyit. Though I'm still not keen on the design of the Kindle, it is a vast improvement on itspredecessor and certainly tolerable. Beyond the device itself, Amazon has done a great jobof rolling out Kindle apps, ensuring that people like me-who have an iPad but not a Kindle-canstill join in the fun. Once you're into the Kindle ecosystem, Amazon locks you in tightly-just asApple does with its iTunes/ iPod ecosystem. It's so easy to buy from Amazon's store and thebooks are so cheap that it's not worth the effort of going elsewhere.

　　While I remain opposed to Amazon's DRM (数字版权管理)-indeed, I'm opposed to DRM onany ebooks-I have to admit that the implementation is so smooth that most Kindle userswon't care at all that their ebooks can't be moved to other devices.

　　The ebook trend is nowhere near peaking. Over the next five years we can expect to seemore and more readers move away from printed books and pick up ebooks instead. But I don'tthink that will mean the death of the printed book.

　　There are some who prefer printed books. They like having shelves filled with books they'veread and books they plan to read; they like the feel of the book in their hands and the differentweights and typefaces and layouts of different titles. In other words, they like the physical formof the book almost as much as the words it contains.

　　I can sympathise with those people. As I wrote earlier this week, my ideal situation would befor publishers to bundle ebooks with printed ones-in much the same way that film studiosbtmdie DVDs with digital copies of films. There's no reason to think that lovers of printed bookswill change their minds. There will undoubtedly be fewer of them as time goes by because morepeople will grow up with ebooks and spend little time with printed ones. However, just as thereare people who love vinyl records(黑胶唱片), even if they were born well into the CD era, therewill still be a dedicated minority who love physical books.

　　Since there are fewer of these people, that will mean fewer bookshops and higher prices forprinted books but I don't think the picture is entirely bleak. There is scope for smaller printruns of lavishly designed printed books and bookshops aimed at book lovers, rather than theStieg Larsson-reading masses. With mainstream readers out of the printed book market, booklovers might even find they get a better experience.

　　56. What can be inferred from Paragraph One?

　　A.Most people buy Kindle 2 mainly because of its low price.

　　B.The author of the passage is a loyal customer of Apple products.

　　C.Amazon's Kindle 2 surpassed Kindle 1 in designing.

　　D.The sales of ebook outnumbered those of paperback in the U. S.

　　57. According to the passage, the reason why the author opposes to Amazon's DRM is that______

　　A.ebooks can only be purchased on Amazon. com

　　B.Kindle books are not compatible with other electronic reading devices

　　C.once implemented, ebooks can't be transferred to other equipments

　　D.ebooks installed on Kindle 2 can't be edited freely

　　58. It can be learned that the trend of ebooks______

　　A.will come to stop any time soon

　　B.will reach the summit in the near future

　　C.will meet its heyday when printed books die

　　D.has already reached its peak

　　59. Why does the author believe that the surging sales of ebooks won't mean the death ofthe printed book?

　　A.Because a minority will stick to their love of printed books.

　　B.Because the majority of book lovers won't change their minds.

　　C.Because people always hold nostalgic feelings towards printed books.

　　D.Because people will return to the printed books as time goes by.

　　60. According to the author, which of the following is TRUE about the future of printedbooks?

　　A.They will be bundled with ebooks.

　　B.They will no longer be available in the market.

　　C.They will be sold in small quantity and high quality.

Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.

　　A bull grazes on dry wheat husks(Phi) in Logan, Kansas, one of the regions hit by therecord drought that has affected more than half of the U. S. and is expected to drive up foodprices.

　　Leadinu water scientists have issued one of the sternest warnings yet about global foodsupplies, saying that the world's population may have to switch almost completely to avegetarian diet over the next 40 years to avoid catastrophic shortages.

　　Adopting a vegetarian diet is one option to increase the amount of water available to growmore food in an increasingly climate-unstable world, the scientists said. Animal protein-richfood consumes 5 to 10 times more water than a vegetarian diet. One third of the world'sarable(适于耕种的) land is used to grow crops to feed animals. Other options to feed peopleinclude eliminating waste and increasing trade between countries in food surplus and those indeficit.

　　"900 million people already go hungry and 2 billion people are malnourished in spite of thefact that per capita food production continues to increase," they said. "With 70% of allavailable water being in agriculture, growing more food to feed an additional 2 billion peopleby 2050 will place greater pressure on available water and land. "

　　The report is being released at the start of the annual world water conference inStockholm, Sweden, where 2,500 politicians, UN bodies, non-governmental groups andresearchers from 120 countries meet to address global water supply problems.

　　Competition for water between food production and other uses will intensify pressure onessential resources, the scientists said. "The UN predicts that we must increase foodproduction by 70% by mid-century. This will place additional pressure on our 'alreadystressed water resources, at a time when we also need to allocate more water to satisfy globalenergy demand--　which is expected to rise 60% over the coming 30 years--and to generateelectricity for the 1.3 billion people currently without it," said the report.

　　Overeating, undernourishment and waste are all on the rise and increased food productionmay face future constraints from water scarcity.

　　"We will need a new recipe to feed the world in the future," said the report's editor, AndersJagerskog.

　　A separate report from the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) said the bestway for countries to protect millions of farmers from food insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa andsouth Asia was to help them invest in small pumps and simple technology, rather than todevelop expensive, large-scale irrigation projects.

　　"Farmem across the developing world are increasingly relying on and benefiting from small-scale,locally-relevant water solutions. These techniques could increase yields up to 300% andadd tens of billions of U. S. dollars to household revenues across sub-Saharan Africa and southAsia. " said Dr. Colin Chartres, the director general.

　　61. What can be inferred from the water scientists' warning?

　　A. The record drought forces half of the U. S. to go hungry.

　　B. The record drought drives up food prices m the U. S.

　　C. Severe food shortage may happen without proper measures.

　　D. A vegetarian diet is the only option to avoid disastrous shortages.

　　62. What do the scientists say can be done to increase food supply?

　　A. Grow more animal protein-rich food.

　　B. Turn pastures into arable lands.

　　C. Promote trade between countries self-sufficient in food.

　　D. Increase the amount of water for food production.

　　63. According to the water scientists' report,

　　A. per capita food production has been increasing

　　B. reduced food supply will make more people malnourished

　　C. 70% of water will be used to feed 2 billion people by 2050

　　64. In regard to the problem of water supply, scientists believe

　　A. more water should be allocated to satisfy energy demand

　　B. food production must be increased to 70% by mid-century

　　C. energy demand will intensify pressure on water resources

　　D. electricity generation must be increased by 60% 30 years later

　　65. What does the IWMI say is the best solution to food insecurity in sub-Saharan Africaand south Asia?

Questions 56 to 60 are based an the followingpassage.

　　Dropping out of university to launch a start-up isold hat. The twist with Joseph Cohen, Dan Getelmanand Jim Grandpre is that their start-up aims toimprove how universities work. In May 2011 thethree founders quit the University of Pennsvlvania. to launch Coursekit,soon renamed asLore.whichhas already raised $ 6m to develop what Mr. Cohen, its 21-year-old chief executive,describes as a social-learning network for the classroom".

　　Lore is part of a trend that builds on the familiarity with social networking that has comewith the success of Facebook. It customizes the rules of a network to meet the specific needsof students. Anyone teaching a class would reasonably worry that students using Facebookwere gossiping rather than learning useful information from their network of friends. Loreallows teachers to control exactly who is in the network by issuing a class-membership codeand to see how they are using it. They can also distribute course materials, contact students,manage tests and grades, and decide what to make public and what to keep private. Studentscan also interact with each other.

　　In the academic year after launching its first version last November, Lore was used in atleast one class in 600 diversities and colleges. Its goal for its second year, about to begin, is tospread rapidly within those 600 institutions, not least to see what the effects of scale are fromhaving lots of classes signed up within the same institution.

　　The firm has a fast-growing army of fans in the faculty common room. Lore, says EdwardBoches, who uses it for his advertising classes at Boston University, makes teaching "moreinteractive, extends it beyond the classroom and stimulates students to learn from each otherrather than just the professor. "

　　Among other challenges for the company, there remains the small matter of figuring out abusiness model. For the moment it has none. Mr. Cohen hopes that eventually Lore couldbecome the primary marketplace for everything from courses to textbooks, but so far theservice is free and carries no advertising. Blackboard, the industry incumbent (占有者), chargesusers for its course-management software. It remains to be seen how it will respond to theupstart(新贵).

　　The lack of a plan does not appear to bother Lore's founders or investors, -who seemcontent to learn a lesson from another university drop-out, Mark Zuckerberg, the co-founder ofFacebook: achieve critical mass in your network and the profits will follow. And after thatperhaps they can expect an honorary degree from the a/ma mater(母校).

　　56. What do we learn from the first paragraph about Lore?

　　A. It specializes in producing old hats.

　　B. It aims to improve the way universities work.

　　C. It invests $ 6m in the development of social network.

　　D. It promotes the communication among classmates.

　　57. What does Lore enable teachers to do?

　　A. Meet specific needs of students.

　　B. Learn useful information from friends.

　　C. Control the online class membership.

　　D. Monitor students' personal privacy.

　　58. For its second-year goal, Lore is to __

　　A. increase fans in the faculty common room

　　B. launch its second version in 600 universities

　　C. make more classes from 600 institutions signed up

　　D. spread its influence within the same institution

　　59. Concerning the prospect of Lore, Mr. Cohen expects it to

　　A. confront with Blackboard as an equal

　　B. offer free service to the advertisers

　　C. cover businesses from courses to textbooks

　　D. Develop its own come-management software

　　60. What do we learn about Lore's founders?

　　A. They can't be bothered to design a business model.

　　B. They learn a lesson from the success of Facebook.

　　C. They will not make profits without drawing mass users.

　　D. They desire to receive an honorary degree from the alma mater.

Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.

　　There is plenty of complaints about how social media--texting in particular--may beharming children's social and intellectual development. But a new study suggests thatconstant instant messaging (IM'ing)and texting among teens may also provide benefits,particularly for those who are introverted( 内向的).

　　British researchers studied instant messages exchanged by 231 teens, aged 14 to 18. All ofthe participants were "regular" or "extensive" IM'ers. In the U. S., two thirds of teens useinstant messaging services regularly, with a full third messaging at least once every day.

　　The researchers analyzed 150 conversations in the study, and reported the results in thejournal Computers in Human Behavior. In 100 of these chats, the study participant beganIM'ing while in a negative emotional state such as sadness, distress or anger. The rest wereconversations begun when the participant was feeling good or neutral. After the chat,participants reported about a 20% reduction in their distress--not enough to completelyeliminate it, but enough to leave them feeling better than they had before reaching out.

　　"Our findings suggest that IM'ing between distressed adolescents and their peers mayprovide emotional relief and consequently contribute to their well-being," the authors write,noting that prior research has shown that people assigned to talk to a stranger either in reallife or online improved their mood in both settings, but even more with IM. And people who talkwith their real-life friends online also report feeling closer to them than those who justcommunicate face-to-face, implying a strengthening of their bond.

　　Why would digital communication trump human contact? The reasons are complex, butmay have something to do with the fact that users can control expression of sadness andother emotions via IM without revealing emotional elements like tears that some mayperceive as embarrassing or sources of discomfort. Studies also show that the anonymity( 匿名) of writing on a device blankets the users in a sense of safety that may prompt people tofeel more comfortable in sharing and discussing their deepest and most authentic feelings.Prior research has shown that expressive writing itself can "vent" emotions and provide asense of relief--and doing so knowing that your words are reaching a sympathetic friend mayprovide even more comfort and potentially be the rapeutic. Researchers also found thatintroverted participants reported more relief from IM conversations when they were distressedthan extraverts ( 内向的) did. As Susan Cain, author of Quiet: The Power of Introverts in aWorld that Can't Stop Talking, wrote recently for TIME: Introverts are often brimming overwith thoughts and care deeply for their friends, family and colleagues. But even the mostsocially skilled introverts sometimes long for a free pass from socializing or talking on thephone. This is what the Internet offers : the chance to connect--but in measured doses andfrom behind a screen.

　　61. What is the finding of the new study by British researchers?

　　A) Instant messaging will hinder children's social and intellectual development.

　　B) Introverted teens may benefit from constant instant messaging.

　　C) Two thirds of Amebean teens use instant messaging every day.

　　D) American teens aged 14 to 18 are extensive instant messaging users.

　　62. What can be inferred from the results of the study?

　　B) Instant messaging can help completely remove teens' negative emotions.

　　C) Chat via instant messaging services makes participants feel good or calm.

　　D) Constant instant messaging can help teens control their negative emotions.

　　63. According to the authors of Computers in Human Behavior,

　　A) talking to strangers on the Internet can improve the mood

　　B) face-to-face talk can strengthen the bond between friends

　　C) Share and discuss more information.

　　B) Produce more expressive writings.

　　D) Find more sympathetic friends.

　　65. What does Susan Cain say about introverts?

　　B) They tend to feel more distressed about IM conversations than extraverts.

　　C) They are more skillful at the art of socializing than extraverts.

　　D) They at times desire to socialize or talk via social media.

Questions 56 to 60 are based on the followingpassage.

　　A study of nearly 140,000 women in the U. S.showed that regular helpings of a small portion ofnuts can have a powerful protective effect against adisease that is threatening to become a globalepidemic. Women who consumed a 28 gram packet of walnuts at least twice a week were 24per cent less likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those who rarely or never ate them. Eatingwalnuts just two or three times a week can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes by almost aquarter.

　　The latest findings, published in the Journal of Nutrition, are not the first to highlight theanti-diabetic effects of walnuts, with earlier research showing similar benefits. However, this isthought to be one of the largest studies to fmd regularly snarling on them can help preventthe condition. Although the latest research was carried out on female nurses, it's likely that thesame benefits apply to men.

　　According to the charity Diabetes UK, at the current rate of increase, the numbersaffected by type 2 diabetes in the UK will rise from around 2.5 million currently to four millionby 2025 and five million by 2030. Left untreated, it can raise the risk of heart attacks,blindness and amputation (截肢). Being overweight, physically inactive and having a poor dietare major risk factors for the disease.

　　Scientists at the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, U. S. , tracked 137,893 nursesaged from 35 to 77 over a ten year period to see how many developed type 2 diabetes. Theirdietary habits were closely monitored, including details on how often they ate nuts, particularlywalnuts. After allowing for body fat and weight, the researchers found eating walnuts one tothree times a month reduced the risk by four per cent, once a week by 13 per cent and at leasttwice a week by 24 per cent.

　　In a report on the findings the researchers said: "These results suggest higher walnutconsumption is associated with a significantly lower risk of type 2 diabetes in women: "Walnuts are rich in healthy fatty acids(脂肪酸)which have been shown to reduce inflammation(炎症) in the body and protect against heart disease, cancer and arthritis(关节炎). Last year,experts at the University of California Los Angeles also found young men in their twenties andthirties who ate walnuts every day increased their sperm count and boosted their fertility.

　　The research comes just after a Louisiana State University study which showed that eatingnuts can reduce people's risk of obesity. The study found that those who consumed varietiessuch as almonds and pistachios(开心果) demonstrated a lower body weight, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference compared to non-consumers. They were also at lower risk ofdeveloping heart disease, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.

　　56. According to the passage, what does "a global epidemic" ( Line 3, Para. 1 ) refer to?

　　A) A disease.

　　B) Type 2 diabetes.

　　A) The number of diabetes patients in the UK will double by 2025.

　　B) Type 2 diabetes is mainly triggered by childhood overweight.

　　C) Diet and exercise may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.

　　D) Type 2 diabetes will cause a significant increase of weight.

　The History of Chinese Americans

　　Chinese have been in the United States for almost two hundred years. In fact. the Chinese had business relations with Hawaii prior to relations with the mainland when Hawaii was not yet part of the United States. But United States investments controlled the capital of Hawaii at that time. In 1788,a ship sailed from Guangzhou to Hawaii. Most of the crewmen were Chinese. They were considered the pioneers of Hawaii. The Immigration Commission reported that the first Chinese arrived in the United States in 1820. eight in 1830 and seven hundred and eighty in 1850. The Chinese population gradually increased and reached 64,199 in 1870.

　　For many years it was common in the United States to associate Chinese Americans with restaurants and laundries. People did not realize that the Chinese had been driven into these occupations by the prejudice and discrimination that faced them in this country.

　　The First Chinese to reach the mainland United States came during the California Gold Rush of 1849. Like most of the other people there, they had come to search for gold. In that largely unoccupied land,the men staked a claim for themselves by placing markers in the ground. However. either because the Chinese were so different from the others or because they worked so patiently that they sometimes succeeded in turning a seemingly worthless mining claim into a profitable one, they became che scapegoats of their envious competitors. They were harassed in many ways. Often they were prevented from working their claims; some localities even passed regulations forbidding them to own claims. The Chinese therefore started to seek out other ways of earning a living. Some of them began to do che laundry for the white miners; others set up small restaurants. (There were almost no women in California in those days,and the Chinese filled a real need by doing this“woman's work”.) Some went to work as farmhands or as fishermen.

　　In the early 1860's many more Chincse arrived in California.This time the men were imported as work crews to construct the first transcontinental railroad.They were sorely needed because the work was so strenuous and dangerous, and it was carried on in such a remote part of the country that the railroad company could not find other laborers for the job. As in the case of their predecessors,these Chinese were almost all males; and like them, too, they encountered a great deal of prejudice. The hostility grew especially strong afrer the railroad project was complete, and the imported laborers returned to California-thousands of them, all out of work. Because there were so many more of them this time,these Chinese drew even more attention than the earlier group did. They were so very different in every respect: in their physical appearance, including a long“pigtail”at the back of their otherwise shaved heads; in the strange, non-Western clothes they wore; in their speech (few had learned English since they planned to go back to China); and in their religion. They were contemptuously called “heathen Chinese” because there were many sacred images in their houses of worship.

　　When times were hard. they were blamed for working for lower wages and taking jobs away from white men. who were in many cases recent immigrants themselves. Anti-Chinese riots broke out in several cities. culminating in arson and bloodshed. Chinese were barred from using the courts and also from becoming American citizens. Californians began to demand that no more Chinese be permitted to enter their state. Finally. in 1882. they persuaded Congress to pass the Chinese Exclusion Act, which stopped the immigration of Chinese laborers. Many Chinese rerurned to their homeland, and their numbers declined sharply in the early part of this century. However. during the World War II,when China was an ally of the United States. the Exclusion laws were ended; a small number of Chinese were allowed to immigrate each year, and Chinese could become American citizens. In 1965, in a general revision of our immigration laws,may more Chinese were permitted to settle here,as discrimination against Asian immigration was abolished.

　　From the start,the Chinese had lived apart in their own separate neighborhoods, which came to be known as “Chinatowns”. In each of them the residents organized an unofficial government to make rules for the community and to settle disputes. Unable to find jobs on the outside, many went into business for themselves-primarily to serve their own neighborhood. As for laundries and restaurants. some of them soon spread to other parts of the city,since such services continued to be in demand among non-Chinese, too. To this day. certain Chinatowns. especially those of San Francisco and New York. are busy. thriving communities, which have become great attractions for tourists and for those who enjoy Chinese food.

　　Most of today's Chincse Americans are the descendants of some of the early miners and railroad workers. Those immigrants had come from the vicinity of Canton in Southeast China. where they had been uneducated farm laborers.The same kind of young men,from the same area and from similar humble origins,migrated to Hawaii in those days. There they fared far better, mainly because they did not encounter hostility. Some married native Hawaiians, and other brought their wives and children over. They were not restricted to Chinatown and many of them soon became successful merchants and active participants in general community affairs.

　　Chinese Americans retain many aspects of their ancient culture. even after having lived here for several generations. For Example, their family ties continue to be remarkably scrong (encompassing grandparents. uncles, aunts, cousins. and others). Members of the family lend each other moral support and also practical help when necessary. From a very young age children are imbued with the old values and attitudes. including respect for their elders and a feeling of responsibility to the family. This helps co explain why there is so little juvenile delinquency (少年犯罪 ) among them.

　　The high regard for education which is deeply imbedded in Chinese culture.and the willingness to work very hard to gain advancement, are other noteworthy characteristics of theirs. This explains why so many descendants of uneducated laborers have succeeded in becoming doctors. lawyers, and other professionals.(Many of the most outstanding Chinese American scholars,scientists, and artists are more recent arrivals, who come from China's former upper class and who represent its high cultural traditions.)

　　Chinese Americans make up only a tiny fraction of our population; there are fewer than half a miilion, living chiefly in California. New York. and Hawaii. As American attitudes toward minorities and toward ethnic differences have changed in recent years, the long-reviled Chinese have gained wide acceptance. Today, they are generally admired for their many remarkable characteristics, and are often held up as an example worth following. And their numerous contributions to their adopted land are much appreciated.

　　5.[C][定位]根据题干中的The Chinese Exclusion Act定位到第5段倒数第2句。

　　解析：原文该句中的during the World War II... the Exclusion laws were ended明确表明本题应选C。干扰项D中的1965在原文该段末句提及，但与Chinese Exclusion Act无关，故不能选。

　　6.[D][定位]根据题干中的Chinatowns和busy and thriving community定位到第6段末句。

　　解析：原文该段提到繁荣的Chinatown时，只提到了San Francisco和New York，D正是其中一个，其他选项均未提及。

　　7.[A][定位]根据题干中的immigrants和Hawaii定位到第7段第3、4句。

　　解析：原文该段第4句中because引出的原因从句表明华人在夏威夷“没有遭到敌视”，A“没有受到歧视”与原文该句意思一致。所以本题应选A。

　　8.[juvenile delinquency]

　　[定位]根据题干中的old values and attitudes定位到第8段最后两句。

　　解析：空白处应为名词(词组)。原文该段最后两句表明孩子们从小就被灌输古代的价值观与看问题的方法，这使他们在青少年时期很少犯罪，也就是说，这些价值观与看问题的方法可有助于减少“青少年犯罪”，即juvenile delinquency。

　　9.[scholars,scientists,and artists]

　　[定位]根据题干中的high cultural traditions和represented定位到第9段末句。

　　解析：空白处应为名词(词组)。原文该段末尾的who represent its high cultural traditions中的who指的是末句开头提到的Many of the most outstanding Chinese American scholars，scientists，and artists。题目将段末的定语从句改写为被动语态，所以who所指的内容就是本题答案，即scholars，scientists and artists。

　　10.[appreciation]

　　[定位]根据题干中的contributions定位到末段末句。

　　解析：空白处应为不可数名词。题目是对原文该句的同义改写，所不同的是，原文的谓语部分是are much appreciated.而题目的是had gained much...，作答时要将appreciated改为其名词形式appreciation，才可作题目中gained的宾语。

Depending on which player you ask, the "Fevernova" ball that sports equipment maker Adidas says provides the ultimate soccer experience is Uncontrollable, too big or just simply "stupid". The ball also has its fans, like England's David Beckham. but so far they seem to have been outnumbered by critics.

　　Adidas says the ball. splashed with gold coloring. is quite simply the best around-25 percent more accurate than the ball used at France 98 thanks to meticulous testing by scientists in Germany.

　　The tongue-twisting nature of its contents confirms that the World Cup ball has come a long way from the leather-and-laces variety that was common as recently as the 1960s.

　　The Fevernova's secret. Adidas says. is its radically improved Syntactic foam and unique knitted Raschel fabric.

　　Given that this is supposed to make the ball faster and provide the freekick specialists like Beckham with more power, it may not be surprising that goalkeepers like Buffon are unhappy. Spain goalkeeper Pedro Contreras said the bail acts "strangely", while Danish keeper Thomas Sorensen admitted gloomily that it would probably result in more spectacular goals. "As a goalkeeper, you have to live with the fact that the makers create balls for the benefit of strikers." he said before leaving Copenhagen for South Korea.

　　But outfield players have also weighed in with criticism, many saying the ball is too light and therefore hard to control. "It’s big and it's too light," Japan's Jiji news agency quoted Brazilian forward Edilson as saying earlier this month. while striker Rivaldo said it soared too far when kicked.

　　Journalists at the main press centre in Yokohama have been given the chance to try out the Fevernova from the penalty spot, with the aim of hitting special targets in the goal. So far. few have been able to score more than five out of ten, although this may have little to do with the quality of the ball.

　　Putz. admits that the ball is on the light side of FIFA's 420 to 445 gram weight requirement. but says it is no bigger than previous balls.

　　The controversy over the ball also has an off-pitch dimension. Industry insiders say it may be no coincidence that players from Brazil. sponsored by Adidas rival Nike, have been among the ball's most vociferous critics.

　　The same might go for the praise dished out for the ball by Beckham. one of the main players used to promote Adidas equipment.

　　【试题】

　　1. How does Adidas describe the "Fevernova”ba11?

　　A) The experience provided by the ball is the best so far.

　　B) The ball is almost impossible to control because of its large size.

　　C) The ball has gone through a long way of development.

　　D) The experience provided by the ball is most welcome by strikers.

　　2. What does the author think about the Syntactic foam and unique Raschel fabric chat are used to make the ball?

　　A) The materials have long been used in history.

　　B) The materials do not sound Familiar.

　　C) The materials are new and advanced.

　　D) The materials improve che precision of the ball.

　　3. The goalkeepers tend to admit reluctantly that_____________.

　　A) the ball is too strange to control

　　B) the ball is so light that it goes too fast

　　C) the ball may make the game more thrilling

　　D) the ball may help to enhance the strikers' skills

　　4. Which of the following js true according to Putz?

　　A) The ball is lighter than but of the same size as the previous ones.

　　B) The ball should have been heavier to meet the required weight.

　　C) The ball should have been bigger than the previous ones.

　　D) The ball is light but still meets the weight requirement.

　　5. According to industry insiders. Beckham's comment on the ball_____________.

　　A) is justified in his daily training

　　B) is out of commercial purpose

　　C) goes as radical as the Brazilian players'

　　D) is similar to that by the Brazilian players

　　1.阿迪达斯如何形容“飞火流星”球?

　　A) 这个球所带来的体验是迄今为止最好的。

　　B) 这个球基本上不可能控制，因为体积太大了。

　　C) 这个球已经经过了很长时间的开发。

　　D) 这个球所带来的体验最为前锋所欢迎。

　　[A]首段首句中的ultimate experience表明Adidas公司认为“飞火流星”是至今最完美的足球，因此选项A为本题答案。

　　2. 作者怎么看用来制造这个球的复合泡沫塑料以及独特的拉歇尔经编针织物?

　　A) 在历史上这种材料已经使用了很长时间。

　　B) 这种材料听上去很陌生。

　　C) 这种材料是新型的先进的。

　　D) 这种材料提高了球的精准度。

　　[B]第3段开头的tongue-twisting表明人们对于制作“飞火流星”的材料及其功能都并不熟悉，因此选项B为本题答案。第3段表明“飞火流星”的材料经过很长时间才研制出来，并非长久以来一直在使用，由此可见。选项A不正确;第4段是Adidas公司的看法，并非作者的看法，因此选项C不符合题意;根据第2段可判断选项D也是Adidas公司的看法。而并非作者的看法。

　　3.守门员会不情愿地承认，______________。

　　A) 这个球很奇怪，很难控制 B)这个球很轻，速度太快

　　C) 这个球会让整场比赛更加精彩 D)这个球可以提高前锋的技艺

　　[C]本题题干中的reluctantly是关键词，指出本题要求查找的是“飞火流星”具有的优点，而这个优点是守门员们不想面对或承认的。选项C与第5段第2句中的gloomily that it would probably result in more spectacular goals 内容相近，符合题意.为本题答案。

　　4.根据Putz所说，下列哪一种说法是正确的?

　　A) 相比以前同样大小的球，这种球更加轻。

　　B) 这种球本应该更重一些，才能达到要求的重量。

　　C) 这种球本应该比以往的球更大一些。

　　D) 这种球很轻，但是仍能达到要求的重量。

　　[D]本题要求正确理解第8段中的on the light side of FIFA's 420 to 445 gram weight requirement，该句应理解为“飞火流星”重量偏轻，但仍属于要求范围内，选项D是正确的理解，为本题答案。

　　5. 根据业内人士所称，贝克汉姆对这种球的评价_________________.

　　A) 是根据他平时的训练所作出的 B)是出于商业目的的考虑

　　C) 跟巴西球员的评价一样激烈 D) 与巴西球员的评价类似

　　[B]概括最后两段可以得知，业内人士认为对“飞火流星”的批评和称赞都与赞助公司有关，也就是说，这些评价都出于商业目的，由此可推断选项B为本题答案。选项A中的training在原文根本没有提及;末段开头的The same might go 表明的是Beckham和巴西球员对“飞火流星”做出的评价源于相似的目的，而非表明他们的评价内容相似，程度相同，因此选项C和D都不正确。

No woman can be too rich or too thin. This saying often attributed to the late Duchess (公爵夫人) of Windsor embodies much of the odd spirit of our times. Being thin is deemed as such a virtue.

　　The problem with such a view is that some people actually attempt to live by it. I myself have fantasies of slipping into narrow designer cloches. Consequently. I have been on a diet for the better-or worse-part of my life. Being rich wouldn't be bad either. but that won’t happen unless an unknown relative dies suddenly in some distant land. leaving me millions of dollars.

　　Where did we go off the track? When did eating butter become a sin, and a little bit of extra flesh unappealing, if not repellent? All religions have certain days when people refrain from eating and excessive eating is one of Christianity's seven deadly sins. However, until quite recently, most people had a problem getting enough to eat. In some religious groups, wealth was a symbol of probable salvation and high morals. and fatness a sign of wealth and well-being.

　　Today the opposite is true. We have shifted lo thinness as our new mark of virtue. The result is that being fat-or even only somewhat overweight-is bad because it implies a lack of moral strength.

　　Our obsession (迷恋) with thinness is also fueled by health concerns. It is true that in this country we have more overweight people than ever before. and that in many cases, being overweight correlates with an increased risk of heart and blood vessel disease. These diseases. however, may have as much to do with our way of life and our high-fat diets as with excess weight. And the associated risk of cancer in the digestive system may be more of a dietary problem-too much fat and a lack of fiber-than a weight problem.

　　The real concern. then. is not that we weigh too much. but that we neither exercise enough nor eat well. Exercise is necessary for strong bones and both heart and lung health. A balanced diet without a lot of fat can also help the body avoid many diseases. We should surely stop paying so much attention to weight. Simply being thin is not enough. It is actually hazardous if those who get (or already are) thin think they are automatically healthy and thus free from paying attention to their overall life-style. Thinness can be pure vainglory (虚荣).

People traveling long distances frequently have to decide whether they would prefer to go by land. sea, or air. Hardly can anyone positively enjoy sitting in a train for mort than a few hours. Train compartments soon get cramped and stuffy. Reading is only a partial solution. for the monotonous rhythm of the wheels clicking on the rails soon lulls you to sleep. During the day, sleep comes in snatches. At night when you really wish to go to sleep you rarely manage to do so. Inevitably you arrive at your destination almost exhausted. Long car journey are even less pleasant. for it is quite impossible even to read. On motorways you can. at least, travel fairly safely at high speeds, but more often than not, the greater pan of the journey is spent on narrow. bumpy roads which are crowded wich traffic. By comparison, trips by sea offer a great variety of civilized comforts. You can stretch your legs on the spacious decks, play games, swim, meet interesting people and enjoy good food-always assuming, of course, that the sea is calm. If it is not and you are likely to get seasick; no form of transport could be worse. Even if you travel in ideal weather, sea journeys take a long time. Relatively few people are prepared to sacrifice up to a third of their holidays for the pleasure of traveling on a ship.

　　Airplanes have the reputation of being dangerous and expensive. But nothing can match them for speed and comfort. Traveling at a height of 30,000 feet. far above the clouds, and at over 500 miles an hour is an exhilarating experience. For a few hours, you settle back in a deep armchair to enjoy the flight. The real escapist can watch a free film show and sip champagne on some services. But even when such refinements are not available, there is plenty to keep you occupied. An airplane offers you an unusual and breathtaking view of the world. You soar effortlessly over high mountains and deep valleys. You really see the shape of the land. If the landscape is hidden from the view. you can enjoy the extraordinary sight of unbroken cloud plains that stretch om for miles before you, while the sun shines brilliantly in a clear sky. The journey is so smooth that there is nothing to prevent you from reading or sleeping. However you decide to spend your time, one thing is certain: you will arrive at your destination fresh and uncrumpled.

　　【选项翻译与答案】

　　1. 作者指出，阅读可以帮助缓解________________。

　　A) 坐火车时的无聊 B) 车轮令人疲惫的声音

　　C) 旅程中的睡意 D)车厢中通风不良的情况

　　[A]原文该段第4句表明阅读是a partial solution,这表明阅读有助于解决某个问题，而这个问题就是该段第2句和第3句提到的坐长途火车会让人觉得烦闷，由此可见，本题答案应为选项A。

　　2.关于长途汽车旅行，我们了解到什么信息?

　　A)很安生，因为汽车通常速度很快。 B)很单调，因为不可能看书。

　　C) 很辛苦，因为根本难以入睡。 　　 D)很危险，因为总是太多车。

　　[B]首段第8句中的for引出一个原因从句，表明一种因果关系，而选项B表达的因果关系与此相同，因此为本题答案。原文该段第9句提到了safely at high speeds，但安全和高速之间并不存在因果关系，因此选项A不正确;选项C没在原文提及，建项D的因果关系也不正确。

　　3. 海上旅行是最糟糕的旅行方式，当_____________。

　　A) 天气很差的时候 B) 旅行者时间很少的时候

　　C) 旅行者晕船的时候 D)海上不平静的时候

　　[C]首段倒数第3句指出了两种因果关系：第一，海洋不平静会导致你晕船;第二，晕船会让你觉得坐船是最糟糕的交通方式，由此可见，本题应选C。在原文虽有提及weather，但与题干关系不大，故A不对;时间的问题虽在下一句提及，但与题干不构成因果关系，故B不正确;D是因其晕船的原因，与题干之间的因果关系不直接，故也不对。

　　A) 坐飞机不像其他交通工具那么累。

　　B) 坐飞机比其他的交通工具更有乐趣。

　　C) 坐飞机比其他的变通工具更贵。

　　D) 坐飞机时的睡眠时间可以比乘坐其他交通工具更长。

　　[A]虽然文章没有明显地比较飞机与其他交通方式，但是从首段的内容来看，可以知道当作者描述其他交通方式时，都提到它们很累人，而第2段末句中的fresh and uncrumpled表明坐飞机旅行不会让旅行者觉得累，由此可见，本题应选A。

　　5. 作者写本文的目的是_______________________.

　　A) 介绍旅游的各种方式 B)指出旅游的最佳方式

　　C) 强调坐飞机旅游的好处 D)比较旅游时各种放松的方式

　　[A]作者在原文首句提到了三种交通方式，然后分别描述了三种方式各自的特点，由此可见，作者写本文是为了介绍三种不同的交通方式，故选A。作者只是描述三种交通方式的特点，没有突山哪一个是最好的，困此选项B不正确;选项C只是第2段的内容，并非全文主题，因此也不是正确答案;本文的主题是交通方式，并非relaxing(放松的方式)，因此选项D不正确。

Not too many decades ago it seemed "obvious" both to the general public and to sociologists that modern society has changed people's natural relations, loosened their responsibilities to kin (亲戚) and neighbors, and substituted in their place superficial relationships with passing acquaintances. However, in recent years a growing body of research has revealed that the "obvious" is not true. It seems that if you are a city resident. you typically know a smaller proportion of your neighbors than you do if you are a resident of a smaller community. But, for the most part, this fact has few significant consequences. It does not necessarily follow that if you know few of your neighbors you will know no one else.

　　Even in very large cities, people maintain close social ties within small, private social worlds. Indeed, the number and quality of meaningful relationships do not differ between more and less urban people. Small-town residents are more involved with kin than are big-city residents. Yet city dwellers compensate by developing friendships with people who share similar interests and activities. Urbanism may produce a different style of life, but the quality of life does not differ between town and city. Nor are residents of large communities any likelier to display psychological symptoms of stress or alienation. a feeling of not belonging, than are residents of smaller communities. However. city dwellers do worry more about crime, and this leads them to a distrust of strangers.

　　These findings do not imply that urbanism makes little or no difference. If neighbors are strangers to one another. they are less likely to sweep the sidewalk of an elderly couple living next door or keep an eye out for young trouble makers. Moreover. as Wirth suggested. there may be a link between a community's population size and its social he.heterogeneity (多样性). For instance, sociologists have found much evidence that the size of a community is associated with bad behavior including gambling, drugs. etc. Large-city urbanites are also more likely than their small-town counterparts to have a cosmopolitan(见多识广者的) outlook. to display less responsibility to traditional kinship roles, to vote for leftist political candidates, and to be tolerant of nontraditional religious groups, unpopular political groups, and so-called undesirables. Everything considered, heterogeneity and unusual behavior seem to be outcomes of large population size.

People have wondered for a long time how their personalities and behaviors arc formed.It's not easy to explain why one person is intelligent and another is not. or why one is cooperative and another is competitive.

　　Social scientists are, of course, extremely interested in these types of question. They want to explain why we possess certain characteristics and exhibits certain behaviors. There are no clear answers yet, but two distinct schools of thought on thee matter have developed. As one might expect the two approaches are very different from one another. and there is a great deal of debate between proponents of each theory. The controversy is often conveniently referred to as"nature/nurture".

　　Those who support the "nature" side of the conflict believe that our personalities and behavior patterns are largely determined by biological and genetic factor. That our environment has little. if anything to do with our abilities. characteristics. and behavior is central to this theory. Taken to an extreme, this theory Maintains that our behavior is predetermined to such a great degree that we are almost completely governed by our instincts.

　　Proponents of the "nurture" theory, or, as they are often called. behaviorists. claim that our environment is more important than our biologically based instincts in determining how we will act. Behaviorists see humans as being whose behavior is almost completely shaped by their surroundings. Their view of the human being is quite mechanistic; they maintain that like machines. humans respond to environmental stimuli as the basis of their behavior.

　　The social and political implications or these two theories are profound. In the United Stares, for example, blacks often score below whites on standardized intelligent test. This leads some "nature" proponents to conclude that blacks are genetically interior to whites. Behaviorists, in contrast. say that the differences in scores are due to the fact that blacks are often deprived of many of the educational and other environmental advantages that white enjoy. and that. as a result. they do not develop the same responses that whites do.

　　Neither of these theories can yet fully explain human behavior. In fact, it is quite likely that the key to our behavior lies somewhere between these two extremes. That the controversy will continue for a long time is certain.

　　[A]第3段首句中的determined by biological and genetic factor和未句中的governed by our instincts/表明“天性论”派会认同选项A的看法。第3段第2句表明选项B中的has nothing to do with... 不正确;原文并未提及选项C中提到的能力、特点和行为之间的关系;选项D只是将第3段末句的某些词语拼合在一起，原文并未讨论有关extreme behaviors的内容。

　　4.关于行为学家我们了解到的是什么?

　　A) 他们相信人类具有机械性。

　　B) 他们将我们的行为比作机器。

　　C) 他们暗示我们对环境做出的反应就像机器做出的反应一样。

　　D) 他们认为，机械性理论也可以适用于我们。

　　[C]本题实际上考查对第4段末句的正确理解。原文该句中的like machines, humans respond...表明作者并非单纯把人类比作机器，而是把人类对环境的反应与机械对环境的反应作对比，故选项C正确。

　　5.“天性论”理论者认为，黑人的分数很低_____________。

　　A) 因为存在教育劣势。

　　B) 显示出黑有和智力低下。

　　C) 与他们真正的智力没有关系。

　　D) 与除遗传以外的其他的因素毫无关系。

　　[D]将第5段第3句与第3段结合起来，可以确定选项D为本题答案，只有选项D才符合“天性论”派对性格与行为形成的看法。选项A是另一派，即行为主义者的看法;原文该处虽也有intelligent一词，但是“天性论”者关注的并非分数与真正的智力之间的关系，他们关注的是造成黑人分数低下的原因，事实上，原文也没有提到分数和智力之间是否存在某种关系，因此选项B和C都没有原文依据。


Divorce doesn't necessarily make adults happy. But toughing it out in an unhappy marriage until it turns around just might do, a new study says.

　　The research identified happy and unhappy spouses. culled (选出 ) from a national database. Of the unhappy partners who divorced. about half were happy five years later. But unhappy spouses who stuck it out often did better. About two-thirds were happy five years later. Study results contradict what seems to be common sense, says David Blankenhorn of the Institute for American Values, a think-tank on the family. The institute helped sponsor the research leam based at the University of Chicago. Findings will be presented in Arlington, Va.. at the "Smart Marriage" conference. sponsored by the Coalition for Marriage. Families and Couples Education.

　　The study looked at data on 5,232 married adults from the National Survey of Families and Households. It included .64.5 who were unhappy. The adults in the national sample were analyzed through 13 measures of psychological well being. Within the five years, 167 of the unhappy were divorced or separated and 478 stayed married.

　　Divorce didn't reduce symptoms of depression, raise self-esteem or increase sense of mastery compared with those who stayed married, the report says.

　　Results were controlled for factors including race, age, gender and income. Staying married did not tend to trap unhappy spouses in violent relationships. What helped the unhappy married turn things around? To supplement the formal study data, the research team asked professional firms to recruit focus groups totaling 55 adults who were "marriage survivors". All had moved from unhappy to happy marriages. These 55 once-discontented married felt their unions got better via one of three routes, the report says:

　　Marital endurance. "Wich time, job situations improved, children got older or better. or chronic ongoing problems got put into new perspective." Partners did not work on their marriages.

　　Marital work. Spouses actively worked "to solve problems, change behavior of improve communication".

　　Personal change. Partners found "alternative ways to improve their own happiness and build a good and happy life despite a mediocre marriage." In effect the unhappy partner changed.

　　【测试题】

　　【选项翻译与答案详解】

　　1.David Blankenhorn认为，人们通常认为_________。

　　A) 对于一段不美满的婚姻，离婚比勉强在一起是更好的解决方法。

　　B) 对于一段不美满的婚姻，离婚不一定是唯一的解决方法。

　　C) 要维系一段不美满的婚姻需要很大的勇气和容忍度。

　　D)要不要结束一段不美满的婚姻对于夫妻来说是一个很难做的决定。

　　[A]根据第2段第5句首先可以推断人们普遍的观点与研究结果相反。第2段开头四句表明坚持不离婚的人最终的情况会变得比离婚的人好，与此相反的观点即为：人们通常认为离婚比坚持不离婚好。因此选项A为本题答案。选项B是本文的主题，研究的结果也支持这个说法，而人们普遍的看法应与此相反;第2段并没有讨沦如何才能维持婚姻，选项C是无关内容;本段对比了婚姻不幸福的人采取不同做法的结果，并没有讨论人们面临婚姻问题时内心的挣扎，因此选项D也是无关内容。

　　2. 下列关于正在讨论的研究哪一个是正确的?

　　A) 研究是由David Blankenhorn任所长的美国价值观研究所主持的。

　　B) 研究是由婚姻、家庭和夫妻教育联盟资助的。

　　C) 研究对象选自基于芝加哥大学的全国数据库。

　　D) 研究报告会被纳入“智慧婚姻”大会的日程当中。

　　[D]第2段末句表明“智慧婚姻”会议的内容包括宣读研究报告，由此可见，选项D是对第2段末句的近义改写。第2段第6句表明选项A中提到的研究所赞助该研究，并非“主持”开展该研究，而且原文也没有表示David Blankenhorn是该研究所的领导，故A不正确;第2段段末sponsored by 引出的名词结构修饰的对象是“智慧婚姻”会议，它并没有赞助该研究，故选项B不对;database在第2段首句提到，the University of Chicago在第6句提到，它们之间并没有关系，选项C也不对。

　　3. 13项心理健康指标是用来__________。

　　A) 作为选择研究对象的标准

　　B) 作为帮助成年人解决不美满婚姻的方法

　　C) 检测所有的5232名已婚人士

　　D) 检测数据库中的所有成年人

　　[C]第3段第3句中的The adults in the national sample指的就是已被抽样出来的受试者，即指第3段首句提到过的5232 married adults，因此本题答案为选项C。第3段第3句表明这13项指标是用于分析the adults in the national sample的，言下之意，sample(subjects) 都已经选好了，因此选项A的说法是错误的;该句也表示这13项指标是用于analyze受试者的，该段没有进一步说明如何帮助婚姻不幸福的夫妇克服困难，因此选项B不难确;本文的主题是婚姻状况，因此, 13项指标所分析的对象应该也与主题密切相关，不需要分析数据库中的所有成年人，只要关注有婚则状况的就行了，因此选项D覆盖范围过于宽泛，也不对。

　　4.形容作者对于离婚的态度最好的形容词是___________.

　　A) 批判的 B)客观的 C)模棱两可的 D)讽刺的

　　[B]首段的结构就像新闻报道的结构，将信息的来源放在了段末，指出本文将要介绍一项新研究的结果，其他段落的首句都含有research, study或report等词，表明本文作者只是客观地转述研究的过程和结果，没有发表自己的见解，因此B正确。虽然本文显示，在遇到不快乐的婚姻的时候，离婚并不一定使人快乐，但不能因此说作者对离婚抱着“批评”或“讽刺”的态度，因为本文主要介绍了一项研究及其结果，因此选项A和D都不正确;作者引用了研究中的很多数据，而且客观地陈述了研究的结果，对divorce的任何评价都来自于那项研究，并没有武断地妄下结论，因此选项C也不正确。

　　5. 根据报告所称，婚姻不美满的人如果只是________也许不能挽救婚姻。

　　A) 坐等生活水平提高

　　B) 得到子女的理解

　　C) 改变自己对于平庸婚姻的态度

　　D) 着手解决自己的问题，加强沟通

　　[B]选项B在原文没有提及，虽然倒数第3段第2句也提到了有关children的信息，但从该句不能推断出与understanding有关的任何信息，因此B符合本题题意。选项A概括了政善婚姻的第1条途径;选项D是第2途径;而选项C是第3条途径。

In department stores and closets all over the world. they are waiting. Their outward appearance seems rather appealing because they come in a variety of styles, textures. and colors. But they are ultimately the biggest deception that exists in the fashion industry today. What are they? They are high heels—a woman's worst enemy (whether she knows it or not). High heel shoes are the downfall of modem society. Fashion myths have led women to believe that they are more beautiful or sophisticated for wearing heels, but in reality, heels succeed in posing short as well as long term hardships. Women should fight the high heel industry by refusing to use or purchase them in order to save the world from unnecessary physical and psychological suffering.

　　For the sake of fairness. it must be noted that there is a positive side to high heels. First. heels are excellent for aerating (使通气) lawns. Anyone who has ever worn heels on grass knows what I am talking about. A simple trip around the yard in a pair of those babies eliminates all need to call for a lawn care specialist. and provides the perfect-sized holes to give any lawn oxygen without all those messy chunks of dirt lying around. Second, heels are quite functional for defense against oncoming enemies. who can easily be scared away By threatening them with a pair of these sharp, deadly fashion accessories.

　　Regardless of such practical uses for heels, the fact remains that wearing high heels is harmful to one's physical health. Talk to any podiatrist (足病医生), and you will hear that the majority of their business comes from high-heel-wearing women. High heels are known to cause problems such as deformed feetand tom toenails. The ask of severe back problems and twisted or broken ankles is three times higher for a high heel wearer than for a flat shoe wearer. Wearing heels also creates che threat of getting a heel caught in a sidewalk crack or a sewer-grate (阴沟栅) and being thrown to the ground-possibly breaking a nose. back, or neck. And of course, after wearing heels for a day. any woman knows she can look forward to a night of pain as she tries to comfort her swollen, aching feel.

　　【测试题】

　　1. What makes women blind to the deceptive nature of high heels?

　　B) Their attempt to show off their status.

　　C) The rich variety of high heel styles.

　　D) Their wish to improve their appearance.

　　2. The author's presentation of the positive side of high heels is meant__________.

　　A) to show their fragile characteristics B) co indicate their feminine features

　　C) to show women’s affection for them D) to emphasize their small size

　　4. The author's chief argument against high heels is that_____________.

　　A) they pose a threat to lawns

　　B) they are injurious to women’s health

　　C) they don’t necessarily make women beautiful

　　D) they are ineffective as a weapon of defense

　　5. It can be inferred from the passage that women should_____________.

　　A) see through the very nature of fashion myths

　　B) boycott the products of the fashion industry

　　C) go co a podiatrist regularly For advice

　　D) avoid following fashion too closely

　　【选项翻译与答案详解】

　　A) 高跟鞋有多种功能。 B) 她们想要展现自己的身份。

　　C)高跟鞋风格多种多样。 D) 她们希望能够改善样貌。

　　[D]根据文章第l段“时尚神话使女性相信穿上高跟鞋会更美丽或气质更优雅”，因此，在四个选项中，只有D与文章所陈述的观点一致;其余三项均不符合。

　　2. 作者对于高跟鞋的正面论述是为了______________。

　　A) 表现讽刺 B) 对女人开玩关

　　C) 对时装工业公平 D) 让自己的论点具有说服力

　　[A]根据文章第2段，高跟鞋有两种积极的作用：一种是极好的草地供氧用具，不用挖土就能在草地上凿出均匀的小洞供草地吸氧;另一种是可击退来犯之敌，高跟鞋轻易就能吓退敌人，由此可知，不论从内容或语气上看，作者旨在对高跟鞋进行嘲讽。故此，在四个选项中，只有A与作者的写作意图相符;其余三项均与文章的意思相悖。

　　3. 作者使用了“那些宝贝”(第2段第4行)的表达来指高跟鞋______________________。

　　A) 是为了显示高跟鞋脆弱的特点 B) 是为了表示高跟鞋的女性特征

　　C)是为了表现女人对高跟鞋的热爱 D) 强调高跟鞋的尺寸很小

　　[C] baby通常是人们对婴儿的爱称，语气中包含有怜爱的成分，而在文章第1段作者也指出高跟鞋颇具吸引力，女性都相信穿高跟鞋能使她们更漂亮、气质更高雅，由此可看出女性对高跟牲的钟爱。结合这两个方面可推断出作者将高跟鞋比作baby.目的只是为了表现女性对高跟鞋的怜爱程度。因此，C与作者所表现的观点相符，故而正确。

　　4. 作者反对高跟鞋的主要论点是________________。

　　A)高跟鞋对草地是一种威胁 B) 高跟鞋对女性健康有害

　　C) 高跟鞋不一定会让女人更美丽 D) 高跟鞋是一种无敌的自卫武器

　　[B]在文章第1段作者就提出自己的观点：高跟鞋是女性最大的敌人，它会给女性带来身体和精神上的伤害。而在文章最后一段作者又详细说明了商跟鞋会给女性带来哪些伤害，l：脚变形，脚指甲受损，严重的腰部疾病，脚踝扭伤，容易跌倒等。因此，本文的大部分篇幅都在描写高跟鞋对女性健康所造成的影响，故B与文章所陈述的观点一致：其余三项均不构成反对高跟鞋的论点。

　　5. 从文章中可以推论，女人应该_____________________。

　　A) 看穿时尚秘密的本质 B)抵制时尚产业的产品

　　C) 定期去找足病医生寻求建议 D) 避免紧贴时尚的做珐

　　[A]在文章第1段和第3段作者指出：时尚神话使女性相信穿上高跟鞋能使她们更漂亮、气质更优雅。但实际情况却是高跟鞋只会给女性带来身体上和精神上的伤害。因此作者呼吁女性与高跟鞋业作战，拒绝购买和穿高跟鞋。因此，A与文章的意思吻合;而B和D的说法文中没有提到，也过于绝对了，C并不是作者的目的。

I have worked with so many people over the years that have made me wonder how on earth they can work at their desk when everything that was in their drawers and in their filing cabinets has ended up in piles on top of their keyboard. One co-worker of mine couldn't remember what clour the top of his desk was! J had to say something. but when J did, he told me that he knew where everything was and needed all that paperwork for different projects he was working on.

　　Some study suggests that about 15% of our time is wasted on looking for misplaced files and paperwork at the office. People gel really defensive when you tell them that their desk is a mess. They say that they don't have time to clean up. as they are too busy. And if they would file certain items they would forger co work on it and would therefore miss the deadline.

　　Hence. first things first. get yourself some folders and a black marker. Take every piece of paper on your desk one by one and file them. Make sure that everything you need to do with these papers is written down on a "to-do" list or even better in your computer organiser. For example. if you have to work on your budget next Monday, write down "work on budget" in your computer organiser so that when Monday comes, your computer will send you a reminder that you need co work on your budget today. Then file that paper in a folder named "budget". Put that folder away-not on your desk!! But in your filing cabinet. Proceed this way with every bit of information that clutters your desk. Do not get distracted by a form that reminds you that you need to do something. Instead. jot it down on your "to-do" list or in your organiser. You won't forget it as it has been written down. File it and move on. Keep focused. Only do one thing at a time for the moment and that is to organise and clean your desk.

　　A) 桌面的颜色这样的事情太琐碎，很难记得住

　　B) 人们总是忙于办公室工作

　　C) 人们总是乱放文具

　　D) 杂乱无章的办公室让人无法忍受

　　[C]题干是首段第2句的内容，是针对该段首句“抽屉及文件柜里的东西最终在他们的键盘上堆积成山”的进一步形象说明，可见作者以此暗示“人们总是胡乱堆放文具”，因此C为本题答案。

　　2. 作者最可能跟同事说什么?

　　A) 作者告诉他要将不必要的文书工作摆在一边。

　　B) 作者让他把正在做的文书工作绐自己。

　　C)作者建议他要记得东西摆放的地方。

　　3. 有些人认为留在桌面上的文件_____________。

　　4. 一个“预算”文件夹是用来___________。

　　A) 保存“待做事情”清单的

　　B) 记录已经做了的事情的

　　D)保存对未来的工作任务有用的东西

　　A) 分类办公室工作的优先顺序

　　B) 将文书工作归档来整理办公桌面

　　C) 把注意力敢在正在做的事情上面

Latino youths need better education for Arizona to take full advantage of the possibilities their exploding population offers. Arizona's fast-growing Latino population offers che state tremendous promise and a challenge. Even more than the aging of the baby boomers. the Latino boom is fundamentally reorienting the state's economic and social structure.

　　Immigration and natural increase have added 600,000 young Latino residents to the state's population in the past decade.Half of the population younger than 18 in both Phoenix and Tucson cs now Latino. Within 20 years. Latinos will make up half of the homegrown entry-level labor pool in the state's two largest labor markets.

　　What is more, Hispanics are becoming key economic players. Most people don't notice it. but Latinos born in Arizona make up much of their immigrant parents' economic and educational deficits. For example. second-generation Mexican-Americans secure an average of 12 grades of schooling where their parents obtained less than nine. That means they erase 70 percent of their parents' lag behind third-generation non-Hispanic Whites in a single generation.

　　A11 of chis hands the state a golden opportunity. At a time when many states will struggle with labor shortages because of modest population growth. Arizona has a priceless chance m build a populous, hardworking and skilled workforce on which to base future prosperity. The problem is that Arizona and its Latino residents may not be able to seize this opportunity. Far too many of Arizona's Latinos drop out of high school or fail to obtain the basic education needed for more advanced study. As a result,educational deficits are holding back many Latinos-and the state as well. To be sure, construction and low-end service jobs continue to absorb tens of thousands of Latino immigrants with little formal education. But over the long tern. most of Arizona's Latino citizens remain ill-prepared to prosper in an increasingly demanding knowledge economy.

　　For the reason, the educational uplift of Arizona's huge Latino population must move to the center of the state's agenda. After all, the education deficits of Arizona's Latino population will severely cramp the fortunes of hardworking people if they go unaddressed and could well undercut the state's ability to compete in the new economy. At the entry level, slower growth rates may create more competition for low-skill jobs. displacing Latinos from a significant means of support. At the higher end. shortages of Latinos educationally ready to move up will make it that much harder for knowledge-based companies staff high-skill positions.

　　【测试题】

　　1. The Latino population is changing Arizona's__________________.

　　【选项翻译与答案详解】

　　1.拉丁裔人口改变了亚利桑那的___________________。

　　A) 人口老龄化问题 B) 教育体系

　　C) 经济结构 D)财政赤字

　　[C]原文首段末句中的reorienting与changing为近义同，而该句表明拉丁裔人口在两方面改变着亚利桑那州，选项C就是这两方面的其中一个。选项A中的aging，选项B中的educational和选项D中的deficits都在文中出现，但都与题干的要求无关。

　　2.我们可以从第三段推断出哪一个看法?

　　A) 亚利桑那的拉丁裔人口是由西班牙裔和墨西哥裔美国人所组成。

　　B) 第一代的拉丁裔是移民而不是在美国土生土长的。

　　C) 第一代的拉丁裔中有70%只受过不到9年的教育。

　　D) 教育体系过去只对非西班牙裔的白人有利。

　　[B]第3段第3句表明第二代墨西哥裔美国人比他们的父母获得更好的教育。而这一句是为了举例说明第2句提到的在Arizona出生的拉丁裔和他们的移民父母之间的区别，由此可见，第2句提到的immigrant parents就是第一代的拉丁裔美国人，immigrant一词表明他们并非在美国出生，因此选项B为正确的推断。

　　3.“教育赤字”(第4段第7行)最可能的意思是__________________。

　　A) 州政府没有在教育上投入大量资金 B)许多拉丁裔穷得无法受教育

　　C) 教育不是一个能够盈利的产业 D)许多拉丁裔都没有受过良好的教育

　　[D]第4段第5句开头的As a result表明本句与上一句形成因果关系，由此可见。本句中的educational deficits与上一句提到的拉丁裔美国人受教育程度较低有关，由此可推断，educational deficits指的应该是受教育不足。因此.选项D为正确的理解。

　　4.作者认为，亚利桑那应该最关注______________。

　　A) 控制拉丁裔人口

　　B) 提高拉丁裔人口的教育水平

　　C) 改善知识经济

　　D) 将拉丁裔人口发展成努力工作的技术性劳动力

　　[B]第5段首句中的move to the cemnter为题干中give highest priority的同义替换，选项B与原文该句的主语educational uplift也意思一致，因此选项B为本题答案。选项A在文中并无提及，选项C和D都在文中提到，但不符合题意，与highest priority无关。

　　5.文章暗示，从长远来看，亚利桑那大部分的拉丁裔人口将会_______________。

　　A) 失业 B)工资很低

　　C) 做低技能的工作 D) 做高技能的工作

　　[C]第4段末句中的ill-prepared和第5段末句中的shortages of Latinos educationally ready都表明从长远来看，拉丁裔美国人受的教育仍然保持较低的水平，由此可推断，他们只能做一些技术要求不高的工作，所以选项C为本题答案。
