　　Questions 26 to 35 are based on the passage you have just heard。
　　Physical activity does the body good, and there’s growing evidence that it helps the brain too. Researchers in the Netherlands report that children who get more exercise, whether at school or on their own, （26）to have higher GPAs and better scores on standardized tests. In a （27）of 14 studies that looked at physical activity and academic（28）, investigators found that the more children moved, the better their grades were in school,（29）in the basic subjects of math, English and reading.
　　The data will certainly fuel the ongoing debate over whether physical education classes should be cut as schools struggle to（30）on smaller budgets. The arguments against physical education have included concerns that gym time may be taking away from study time. With standardized test scores in the U.S.（31） in recent years, some administrators believe students need to spend more time in the classroom instead of on the playground. But as these findings show, exercise and academics may not be（32） exclusive. Physical activity can improve blood （33） to the brain, fueling memory, attention and creativity, which are （34） to learning. And exercise releases hormones that can improve（35）and relieve stress, which can also help learning. So while it may seem as if kids are just exercising their bodies when they’re running around, they may actually be exercising their brains as well.

　　Section B
　　Directions： In this section， you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it。 Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs。 Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived。 You may choose a paragraph more than once。 Each paragraph is marked with a letter。 Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2。

　　Finding the Right Home—and Contentment， Too
　　[A] When your elderly relative needs to enter some sort of long-term care facility—a moment few parents or children approach without fear—what you would like is to have everything made clear。
　　[B] Does assisted living really mark a great improvement over a nursing home， or has the industry simply hired better interior designers？ Are nursing homes as bad as people fear， or is that an out-moded stereotype （固定看法）？ Can doing one’s homework really steer families to the best places？ It is genuinely hard to know。
　　[C] I am about to make things more complicated by suggesting that what kind of facility an older person lives in may matter less than we have assumed。 And that the characteristics adult children look for when they begin the search are not necessarily the things that make a difference to the people who are going to move in。 I am not talking about the quality of care， let me hastily add。 Nobody flourishes in a gloomy environment with irresponsible staff and a poor safety record。 But an accumulating body of research indicates that some distinctions between one type of elder care and another have little real bearing on how well residents do。
　　[D] The most recent of these studies， published in The journal of Applied Gerontology， surveyed 150 Connecticut residents of assisted living， nursing homes and smaller residential care homes （known in some states as board and care homes or adult care homes）。 Researchers from the University of Connecticut Health Center asked the residents a large number of questions about their quality of life， emotional well-being and social interaction， as well as about the quality of the facilities。
　　[E] “We thought we would see differences based on the housing types，” said the lead author of the study， Julie Robison， an associate professor of medicine at the university。 A reasonable assumption—don’t families struggle to avoid nursing homes and suffer real guilt if they can’t？
　　[F] In the initial results， assisted living residents did paint the most positive picture。 They were less likely to report symptoms of depression than those in the other facilities， for instance， and less likely to be bored or lonely。 They scored higher on social interaction。
　　[G] But when the researchers plugged in a number of other variables， such differences disappeared。 It is not the housing type， they found， that creates differences in residents’ responses。 “It is the characteristics of the specific environment they are in， combined with their own personal characteristics—how healthy they feel they are， their age and marital status，” Dr。 Robison explained。 Whether residents felt involved in the decision to move and how long they had lived there also proved significant。
　　[H] An elderly person who describes herself as in poor health， therefore， might be no less depressed in assisted living （even if her children preferred it） than in a nursing home。 A person who bad input into where he would move and has had time to adapt to it might do as well in a nursing home as in a small residential care home， other factors being equal。 It is an interaction between the person and the place， not the sort of place in itself， that leads to better or worse experiences。 “You can’t just say， ‘Let’s put this person in a residential care home instead of a nursing home—she will be much better off，” Dr。 Robison said。 What matters， she added， “is a combination of what people bring in with them， and what they find there。”
　　[I] Such findings， which run counter to common sense， have surfaced before。 In a multi-state study of assisted living， for instance， University of North Carolina researchers found that a host of variables—the facility’s type， size or age； whether a chain owned it； how attractive the neighborhood was—had no significant relationship to how the residents fared in terms of illness， mental decline， hospitalizations or mortality。 What mattered most was the residents’ physical health and mental status。 What people were like when they came in had greater consequence than what happened one they were there。
　　[J] As I was considering all this， a press release from a respected research firm crossed my desk， announcing that the five-star rating system that Medicare developed in 2008 to help families compare nursing home quality also has little relationship to how satisfied its residents or their family members are。 As a matter of fact， consumers expressed higher satisfaction with the one-star facilities， the lowest rated， than with the five-star ones。 （More on this study and the star ratings will appear in a subsequent post。）
　　[K] Before we collectively tear our hair out—how are we supposed to find our way in a landscape this confusing？—here is a thought from Dr。 Philip Sloane， a geriatrician（老年病学专家）at the University of North Carolina：“In a way， that could be liberating for families。”
　　[L] Of course， sons and daughters want to visit the facilities， talk to the administrators and residents and other families， and do everything possible to fulfill their duties。 But perhaps they don’t have to turn themselves into private investigators or Congressional subcommittees。 “Families can look a bit more for where the residents are going to be happy，” Dr。 Sloane said。 And involving the future resident in the process can be very important。
　　[M] We all have our own ideas about what would bring our parents happiness。 They have their ideas， too。 A friend recently took her mother to visit an expensive assisted living/nursing home near my town。 I have seen this place—it is elegant， inside and out。 But nobody greeted the daughter and mother when they arrived， though the visit had been planned； nobody introduced them to the other residents。 When they had lunch in the dining room， they sat alone at a table。
　　[N] The daughter feared her mother would be ignored there， and so she decided to move her into a more welcoming facility。 Based on what is emerging from some of this research， that might have been as rational a way as any to reach a decision。
　　36。 Many people feel guilty when they cannot find a place other than a nursing home for their parents。
　　37.Though it helps for children to investigate care facilities， involving their parents in the decision-making process may prove very important。
　　38.It is really difficult to tell if assisted living is better than a nursing home。
　　39.How a resident feels depends on an interaction between themselves and the care facility they live in。
  　40.The author thinks her friend made a rational decision in choosing a more hospitable place over an apparently elegant assisted living home。
　　41.The system Medicare developed to rate nursing home quality is of little help to finding a satisfactory place。
　　42.At first the researchers of the most recent study found residents in assisted living facilities gave higher scores on social interaction。
　　43.What kind of care facility old people live in may be less important than we think。
　　44.The findings of the latest research were similar to an earlier multi-state study of assisted living。
　　45.A resident’s satisfaction with a care facility has much to do with whether they had participated in the decision to move in and how long they had stayed there。

　　Section C
　　Directions： There are 2 passages in this section。 Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements。 For each of them there are four choices marked A），B），C） and D）。 You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre。
　　Passage one
　　Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage。
　　As Artificial Intelligence（AI） becomes increasingly sophisticated， there are growing concerns that robots could become a threat。 This danger can be avoided， according to computer science professor Stuart Russell， if we figure out how to turn human values into a programmable code。
　　Russell argues that as robots take on more complicated tasks， it’s necessary to translate our morals into AI language。
　　For example， if a robot does chores around the house， you wouldn’t want it to put the pet cat in the oven to make dinner for the hungry children。 “You would want that robot preloaded with a good set of values，” said Russell。
　　Some robots are already programmed with basic human values。 For example， mobile robots have been programmed to keep a comfortable distance from humans。 Obviously there are cultural differences， but if you were talking to another person and they came up close in your personal space， you wouldn’t think that’s the kind of thing a properly brought-up person would do。
　　It will be possible to create more sophisticated moral machines， if only we can find a way to set out human values as clear rules。
　　Robots could also learn values from drawing patterns from large sets of data on human behavior。 They are dangerous only if programmers are careless。
　　The biggest concern with robots going against human values is that human beings fail to so sufficient testing and they’ve produced a system that will break some kind of taboo（禁忌）。
　　One simple check would be to program a robot to check the correct course of action with a human when presented with an unusual situation。
　　If the robot is unsure whether an animal is suitable for the microwave， it has the opportunity to stop， send out beeps（嘟嘟声）， and ask for directions from a human。 If we humans aren’t quite sure about a decision， we go and ask somebody else。
　　The most difficult step in programming values will be deciding exactly what we believe in moral， and how to create a set of ethical rules。 But if we come up with an answer， robots could be good for humanity。
　　46.What does the author say about the threat of robots？
　　A）It may constitute a challenge to computer progranmers。
　　B）It accompanies all machinery involving high technology。
　　C）It can be avoided if human values are translated into their language。
　　D）It has become an inevitable peril as technology gets more sophisticated。
　　47.What would we think of a person who invades our personal space according to the author？
　　A）They are aggressive。
　　B）They are outgoing。
　　C）They are ignorant。
　　D）They are ill-bred。
　　48.How do robots learn human values？
　　A）By interacting with humans in everyday life situations。
　　B）By following the daily routines of civilized human beings。
　　C）By picking up patterns from massive data on human behavior。
　　D）By imitating the behavior of property brought-up human beings。
　　49.What will a well-programmed robot do when facing an unusual situation？
　　A）keep a distance from possible dangers。
　　B）Stop to seek advice from a human being。
　　C）Trigger its built-in alarm system at once。
　　D）Do sufficient testing before taking action。
　　50.What is most difficult to do when we turn human values into a programmable code？
　　A）Determine what is moral and ethical。
　　B）Design some large-scale experiments。
　　C）Set rules for man-machine interaction。
D）Develop a more sophisticated program。

　　Passage Two
　　Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage。
　　Why do some people live to be older than others？ You know the standard explanations： keeping a moderate diet， engaging in regular exercise， etc。 But what effect does your personality have on your longevity（长寿）？Do some kinds of personalities lead to longer lives？ A new study in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society looked at this question by examining the personality characteristics of 246 children of people who had lived to be at least 100。
　　The study shows that those living the longest are more outgoing， more active and less neurotic （神经质的） than other people。 Long-living women are also more likely to be sympathetic and cooperative than women with a normal life span。 These findings are in agreement with what you would expect from the evolutionary theory： those who like to make friends and help others can gather enough resources to make it through tough times。
　　Interestingly， however， other characteristics that you might consider advantageous had no impact on whether study participants were likely to live longer。 Those who were more self-disciplined， for instance， were no more likely to live to be very old。 Also， being open to new ideas had no relationship to long life， which might explain all those bad-tempered old people who are fixed in their ways。
　　Whether you can successfully change your personality as an adult is the subject of a longstanding psychological debate。 But the new paper suggests that if you want long life， you should strive to be as outgoing as possible。
　　Unfortunately， another recent study shows that your mother’s personality may also help determine your longevity。 That study looked at nearly 28，000 Norwegian mothers and found that those moms who were more anxious， depressed and angry were more likely to feed their kids unhealthy diets。 Patterns of childhood eating can be hard to break when we’re adults， which may mean that kids of depressed moms end up dying younger。
　　Personality isn’t destiny（命运）， and everyone knows that individuals can learn to change。 But both studies show that long life isn’t just a matter of your physical health but of your mental health。
　　51。 The aim of the study in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society is____。
　　A）to see whether people’s personality affects their life span
　　B）to find out if one’s lifestyle has any effect on their health
　　C）to investigate the role of exercise in living a long life
　　D）to examine all the factors contributing to longevity
　　52。 What does the author imply about outgoing and sympathetic people？
　　A）They have a good understanding of evolution。
　　B）They are better at negotiating an agreement。
　　C）They generally appear more resourceful。
　　D）They are more likely to get over hardship。
　　53。 What finding of the study might prove somewhat out of our expectation？
　　A）Easy-going people can also live a relatively long life。
　　B）Personality characteristics that prove advantageous actually vary with times。
　　C）Such personality characteristics as self-discipline have no effect on longevity。
　　D）Readiness to accept new ideas helps one enjoy longevity。
　　54。 What does the recent study of Norwegian mothers show？
　　A）Children’s personality characteristics are invariably determined by their mothers。
　　B）People with unhealthy eating habits are likely to die sooner。
　　C）Mothers’ influence on children may last longer than fathers’。
　　D）Mothers’ negative personality characteristics may affect their children’s life spans。
　　55.What can we learn from the findings of the two new studies？
　　A）Anxiety and depression more often than not cut short one’s life span。
　　B）Longevity results from a combination of mental and physical health。
　　C）Personality plays a decisive role in how healthy one is。
D）Health is in large part related to one’s lifestyle。

　　Part III Reading Comprehension （40 minutes）
　　Section A 
　　Directions: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. 
　　Contrary to popular belief, older people generally do not want to live with their children. Moreover, most adult children _____(26)every bit as much care and support to their aging parents as was the case in the "good old days", and roost older people do not feel _____(27). 
　　About 80% of people 65 years and older have living children, and about 90% of them have _____(28)contact with their children. About 75% of elderly parents who don't go to nursing homes live within 30 minutes of at least one of their children. 
　　However, _____(29)having contact with children does not guarantee happiness in old age. In fact, some research has found that people who are most involved with their families have the lowest spirits. This research may be _____(30), however, as ill health often makes older people more _____(31)and thereby increases contact with family members. So it is more likely that poor health, not just family involvement, _____(32)spirits. 
　　Increasingly, researchers have begun to look at the quality of relationships, rather than at the frequency of contact, between the elderly and their children. If parents and children share interests and values and agree on childrearing practices and religious _____(33)they are likely to enjoy each other's company.

　　Section B 
　　Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs.

Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2. 
Could Food Shortages Bring Down Civilization? 
　　[A] For many years I have studied global agricultural, population, environmental and economic trends and their interactions. The combined effects of those trends and the political tensions they generate point to the breakdown of governments and societies. Yet I, too, have resisted the idea that food shortages could bring down not only individual governments but also our global civilization. 
　　[B] I can no longer ignore that risk. Our continuing failure to deal with the environmental declines that are undermining the world food economy forces me to conclude that such a collapse is possible. 
　　[C] As demand for food rises faster than supplies are growing, the resulting food-price inflation puts severe stress on the governments of many countries. Unable to buy grain or grow their own, hungry people take to the streets. Indeed, even before the steep climb in grain prices in 2008, the number of failing states was expanding. If the food situation continues to worsen, entire nations will break down at an ever increasing rate. In the 20th century the main threat to international security was superpower conflict; today it is failing states. 
　　[D] States fail when national governments can no longer provide personal security, food security and basic social services such as education and health care. When governments lose their control on power, law and order begin to disintegrate. After a point, countries can become so dangerous that food relief workers are no longer safe and their programs are halted. Failing states are of international concern because they are a source of terrorists, drugs, weapons and refugees(难民), threatening political stability everywhere. 
　　[E] The surge in world grain prices in 2007 and 2008—and the threat they pose to food security——has a different, more troubling quality than the increases of the past. During the second of the 20th century, grain prices rose dramatically several times. In 1972, for instance, the Soviets. I recognizing their poor harvest early, quietly cornered the world wheat market. As a result, wheat prices elsewhere more than doubled, pulling rice and com prices up with them. But this and other price shocks were event-driven——drought in the Soviet Union, crop-shrinking heat in the U.S. Corn Belt. And the rises were short-lived: prices typically returned to normal with the next harvest. 
　　[F]In contrast, recent surge in world grain prices is trend-driven, making it unlikely to reverse without a reversal in the trends themselves. On the demand side, those trends include the ongoing addition of more than 70 million people a year, a growing number of people wanting to move up the food chain to consume highly grain-intensive meat products, and the massive diversion(转向)of U.S. grain to the production of bio-fuel. 
　　[G]As incomes rise among low-income consumers, the potential for further grain consumption is huge. But that potential pales beside the never-ending demand for crop-based fuels. A fourth of this year's U.S. grain harvest will go to fuel cars. 
　　[H]What about supply? The three environmental trends——the shortage of fresh water, the loss of topsoil and the rising temperatures——are making it increasingly hard to expand the world's grain supply fast enough to keep up with demand. Of all those trends, however, the spread of water shortages poses the most immediate threat. The biggest challenge here is irrigation, which consumes 70% the world's fresh water. Millions of irrigation wells in many countries are now pumping water out of underground sources faster than rainfall can refill them. The result is falling water tables(地下水位)in countries with half the world's people, including the three big grain producers——China, India and the U.S. 
　　[I]As water tables have fallen and irrigation wells have gone dry, China's wheat crop, the world's largest, has declined by 8% since it peaked at 123 million tons in 1997. But water shortages are even more worrying in India. Millions of irrigation wells have significantly lowered water tables in almost every state. 
　　[J]As the world's food security falls to pieces, individual countries acting in their own self-interest are actually worsening the troubles of many. The trend began in 2007, when leading wheat-exporting countries such as Russia and Argentina limited or banned their exports, in hopes of increasing local food supplies and thereby bringing down domestic food prices. Vietnam banned its exports for several months for the same reason. Such moves may eliminate the fears of those living in the exporting countries, but they are creating panic in importing countries that must rely on what is then left for export. 
　　[K]In response to those restrictions, grain-importing countries are trying to nail down long-term trade agreements that would lock up future grain supplies. Food-import anxiety is even leading to new efforts by food-importing countries to buy or lease farmland in other countries. In spite of such temporary measures, soaring food prices and spreading hunger in many other countries are beginning to break down the social order. 
　　[L]Since the current world food shortage is trend-driven, the environmental trends that cause it must be reversed. We must cut carbon emissions by 80% from their 2006 levels by 2020, stabilize the world's population at eight billion by 2040, completely remove poverty, and restore forests and soils. There is nothing new about the four objectives. Indeed, we have made substantial progress in some parts of the world on at least one of these——the distribution of family-planning services and the associated shift to smaller families. 
　　[M]For many in the development community, the four objectives were seen as positive, promoting development as long as they did not cost too much. Others saw them as politically correct and morally appropriate. Now a third and far more significant motivation presents itself: meeting these goals may necessary to prevent the collapse of our civilization. Yet the cost we project for saving civilization would amount to less than $200 billion a year, 1/6 of current global military spending. In effect, our plan is the new security budget.

36.The more recent steep climb in grain prices partly results from the fact that more and more people want to consume meat products. 
37.Social order is breaking down in many countries because of food shortages. 
38.Rather than superpower conflict, countries unable to cope with food shortages now constitute the main threat to world security. 
39.Some parts of the world have seen successful implementation of family planning. 
40.The author has come to agree that food shortages could ultimately lead to the collapse of world civilization. 
41.Increasing water shortages prove to be the biggest obstante to boosting the world's grain production. 
42.The cost for saving our civilization would be considerably less than the world's current military spending. 
43.To lower domestic food prices, some countries limited or stopped their grain exports. 
44.Environmental problems must be solved to case the current global food shortage. 
45.A quarter of this year's American grain harvest will be used to produce bio-fuel for cars.

　　Section C 
　　Passage One 
　　Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage. 
　　Declining mental function is often seen as a problem of old age，but certain aspects of brain function actually begin their decline in young adulthood, a new study suggests. 
　　The study, which followed more than 2,000 healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 60, found that certain mental functions—including measures of abstract reasoning, mental speed and puzzle-solving—started to dull as early as age 27. 
　　Dips in memory, meanwhile, generally became apparent around age 37. 
　　On the other hand, indicators of a person’s accumulated knowledge—like performance on tests of vocabulary and general knowledge—kept improving with age, according to findings published in the journal 　　Neurobiology of Aging. 
　　The results do not mean that young adults need to start worrying about their memories. Most people’s minds function at a high level even in their later years, according to researcher Timothy Salthouse. 
　　"These patterns suggest that some types of mental flexibility decrease relatively early in adulthood, but that the amount of knowledge one has, and the effectiveness of integrating it with one’s abilities，may 　　increase throughout all of adulthood if there are no dispases," Salthouse said in a news release. 
　　The study included healthy, educated adults who took standard tests of memory, reasoning and perception at the outset and at some point over the next seven years. 
　　The tests are designed to detect subtle (细微的)changes in mental function, and involve solving Puzzles, recalling words and details from stories, and identifying patterns in collections of letters and symbols. 
　　In general, Salthouse and his colleagues found, certain aspects of cognition (认知能力)generally started to decline in the late 20s to 30s. 
　　The findings shed light on normal age-related changes in mental function, which could aid in understanding the process of dementia(痴呆),according to the researchers. 
　　“By following individuals over time,” Salthouse said, "we gain insight in cognition changes, and may possibly discover ways to slow the rate of decline.” 
　　The researchers are currently analyzing, the study participants' health and lifestyle to see which factors might influence age-related cognitive changes. 　
46.What is the common view of mental function?
A.It varies from person to person. 
C.It gradually expands with age. 
B.It weakens in one’s later years. 
D.It indicates one’s health condition.
47.What does the new study find about mental functions? 
A.Some diseases inevitably lead to their decline. 
B.They reach a peak at the age of 20 for most people. 
C.They are closely related to physical' and mental exercise. 
D.Some of them begin to decline when people are still young.
48.What does Timothy Salthouse say about people's minds in most cases?
A.They tend to decline in people’s later years. 
B.Their flexibility determines one’s abilities. 
C.They function quite well even in old age. 
D.Their functioning is still a puzzle to be solved.
49.Although people’s minds may function less flexibly as they age, they_____.
A.may be better at solving puzzles 
B.can memorize things with more ease 
C.may have greater facility in abstract reasoning 
D.can put what they have learnt into more effective use
50.According to Salthouse, their study may help us_____.
A.find ways to slow down our mental decline 
6.find ways to boost our memories 
C.understand the complex process of mental functioning 
D.understand the relation between physical and mental health

　　Passage Two 
　　Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage. 
　　The most important thing in the news last week was the rising discussion in Nashville about the educational needs of children. The shorthand(简写)educators use for this is "pre-K"—meaning instruction before kindergarten—and the big idea is to prepare 4-year-olds and even younger kids to be ready to succeed on their K-12 journey. 
　　But it gets complicated. The concept has multiple forms, and scholars and policymakers argue about the shape, scope and cost of the ideal program. 
　　The federal Head Start program, launched 50 years ago, has served more than 30 million children. It was based on concepts developed at Vanderbilt University's Peabody College by Susan Gray, the legendary pioneer in early childhood education research. 
　　A new Peabody study of the Tennessee Voluntary Pre-K program reports that pre-K works, but the gains are not sustained through the third grade. It seems to me this highlights quality issues in elementary schools more than pre-K, and indicates longer-term success must connect pre-K with all the other issues, related to educating a child. 
　　Pre-K is controversial. Some critics say it is a luxury and shouldn't be free to families able to pay. Pre-K advocates insist it is proven and will succeed if integrated with the rest of the child's schooling. I lean toward the latter view. 
　　This is, in any case, the right conversation to be having now as Mayor Megan Barry takes office. She was the first candidate to speak out for strong pre-K programming. The important thing is for all of us to keep in mind the real goal and the longer, bigger picture. 
　　The weight of the evidence is on the side of pre-K that early intervention (干预)works. What government has not yet found is the political will to put that understanding into full practice with a sequence of smart schooling that provides the early foundation. 
　　For this purpose, our schools need both the talent and the organization to educate each child who arrives at the schoolhouse door. Some show up ready, but many do not at this critical time when young brains are developing rapidly.
51.What does the author say about pre-kindergarten education?
A.It should cater to the needs of individual children. 
B.It is essential to a person's future academic success. 
C.Scholars and policymakers have different opinions about it. 
D.Parents regard it as the first phase of children's development.
52.What does the new Peabody study find?
A.Pre-K achievements usually do not last long. 
B.The third grade marks a new phase of learning. 
C.The third grade is critical to children's development. 
D.Quality has not been the top concern of pre-K programs.
53.When does the author think pre-K works the best? 
A.When it is accessible to kids of all families. 
B.When it is made part of kids' education. 
C.When it is no longer considered a luxury. 
D.When it is made fun and enjoyable to kids.
54.What do we learn about Mayor Megan Barry?
A.She knows the real goal of education. 
B.She is a mayor of insight and vision. 
C.She has once run a pre-K program. 
D.She is a firm supporter of pre-K.
55.What does the author think is critical to kids' education?
A.Teaching method. 
B.Kids' interest. 
C.Early intervention. 
D.Parents' involvement.

Section B
Ancient Greek Wisdom Inspires Guidelines to Good Life
[A] Is it possible to enjoy a peaceful life in a world that is increasingly challenged by threats and uncertainties from wars, terrorism, economic crises and a widespread outbreak of infectious diseases? The answer is yes, according to a new book The 10 Golden Rules: Ancient Wisdom from the Greek Philosophers on Living a Good Life. The book is co-authored by Long Island University's philosophy professor Michael Soupios and economics professor Panos Mourdoukoutas.
[B] The wisdom of the ancient Greek philosophers is timeless, says Soupios. The philosophy professor says it is as relevant today as when it was first written many centuries ago. "There is no expiration(失效)date on wisdom," he says "There is no shelf life on intelligence. I think that things have become very gloomy these day, lots of misunderstanding, misleading cues, a lot of what the ancients would have called sophistry(诡辩). The nice thing about ancient philosophy as offered by the Greeks is that they tended to see life clear and whole, in a way that we tend not to see life today."
Examine your life
[C] Soupies, along with his co-author Panos Mourdoukoutas, developed their 10 golden rules by turning to the men behind that philosophy-Aristotle, Socrates, Epictetus and Pythagoras, among others. The first rule-examine your life-is the common thread that runs through the entire book. Soupios says that it is based on Plato's observation that the unexamined life is not worth living. "The Greek are always concerned about boxing themselves in, in terms of convictions(信念)," he says. "So take a step back, switch off the automatic pilot and actually stop and reflect about things like our priorities, our values, and our relationships."
Stop worrying about what you can not control
[D] As we begin to examine our life, Soupios says, we come to Rule No.2: Worry only about things that you can control. "The individual who promoted this idea was a Stoic philosopher His name is Epictetus, "he says." And what the Stoics say in general is simply this. There is a larger plan in life. You are not really going to be able to understand all of the dimerisions of this plan. You are not going to be able to control the dimensions of this plan."
[E]So, Soupios explains, it is not worth it to waste our physical, intellectual and spiritual energy worrying about things that are beyond our control. "I can not control whether or not I wind up getting the disease swine flu, for example." He says. "I mean, there are some cautious steps. I can take, but ultimately I can not guarantee myself that. So what Epictetus would say is sitting at home worrying about that would be wrong and wasterful and irrational. You should live your life attempting to identify and control those things which you can genuinely control."
Seek true pleasure
[F]To have a meaningful, happy life we need friends. But according to Aristotle-a student of Plato and teacher of Alexander the Great-most relationships don't qualify as true friendships. "Just because I have a business relationship with an individual and I can profit from that relationship, it does not necessarily mean that this person is my friend." Soupios says. "Real friendship is when two individuals share the same soul. It is a beautiful and uncharacteristically poctic image that Aristotle offers."
[G]In our pursuit of the good life, he says, it is important to seek out true pleasures-advice which was originally offered by Epicurus. But unlike the modern definition of Epicureanism as a life of indulgence(放纵)and luxury, for the ancient Greeks, it meant finding a state of calm, peace and mental case.
[H]"This was the highest and most desirable form of pleasure and happiness for the ancient Epicureans." Soupios says. "This is something that is very much well worth considering here in the modern era. I do not think that we spend nearly enough time trying to concentrate on achieving a sort of calmness, a sort of contentment in mental and spiritual, which was identified by these people as the gighest form of happiness and pleasure."
Do good to others
[I]Other golden rules counsel us to master ourselves, to avoid excess and not to be a prosperous(发迹的)fool. There are also rules dealing with interpersonal relationships. Be a responsible human being and do not do evil things to others.
[J]"This is Hesiod, of course, a younger contemporary poet, we believe, with Homer," Soupios says. "Hesiod offers an idea-which you very often find in some of the word's great religions, in the Judeo-Christian tradition and in Islam an others-that in some sense, when you hurt another human being, you hurt yourself. That damaging other people in your community and in your life, trashing relationships, results in a kind of self-inflicted(自己招致的)spiritual wound."
[K]Instead, Soupios says,ancient wisdom urges us to do good. Golden Rule No.10 for a good life is that kindness toward others tends to be rewarded.
[L]"This is Aesop, the fabulist(寓言家), the man of these charming little tales, often told in terms of animals and animal relationships." He says. "I think what Aesop was suggesting is that when you offer a good turn to another human being. One can hope that that good deed will come back and sort of pay a profit to you, the doer of the good deed. Even if there is no concrete benefit paid in response to you good deed. At the very least, the doer of the good deed has the opportunity to enjoy a kind of spiritually enlightened moment."
[M]Soupios say following the 10 Golden Rules based on ancient wisdom can guide us to the path of the good life where we stop living as onlookers and become engaged and happier human beings. And that, he notes, is a life worth living.

36.According to an ancient Greek philosopher, it is impossible for us to understand every aspect of our life.
37.Ancient Philosophers saw life in a different light from people of today.
38.Not all your business partners are your soul mates.
49.We can live a peaceful life despite the various challenges of the modern world.
40.The doer of a good deed can feel spiritually rewarded even when they gain no concrete benefits.
41.How to achieve meatal calmness and contentment is well worth our consideration today.
42.Michael Soupios suggests that we should stop and think carefully about our priorities in life.
43.Ancient philosophers strongly advise that we do good.
44.The wise teachings of ancient Greek thinkers are timeless, and are applicable to contemporary life.
45.Do harm to others and you do harm to yourself.

　　Section C 
　　Passage One 
　　Attitudes toward new technologies often along generational lines. That is, generally, younger people tend to outnumber older people on the front end of a technological shift. 
　　It is not always the case, though. When you look at attitudes toward driverless cars, there doesn't seem to be a clear generational divide. The public overall is split on whether they'd like to use a driverless car. In a study last year, of all people surveyed, 48 percent said they wanted to ride in one, while 50 percent did not. 
　　The face that attitudes toward self-driving cars appear to be so steady across generations suggests how transformative the shift to driverless cars could be. Not everyone wants a driverless car now-and no one can get one yet-but among those who are open to them, every age group is similarly engaged. 
　　Actually, this isn't surprising. Whereas older generations are sometime reluctant to adopt new technologies, driverless cars promise real value to these age groups in particular. Older adults, especially those with limited mobility or difficulty driving on their own, are one of the classic useeases for driverless cars. 
　　This is especially interesting when you consider that younger people are generally more interested in travel-related technologies than older ones. 
　　When it comes to driverless cars, differences in attitude are more pronounced based on factors not related to age. College graduates, for example, are particularly interested in driverless cars compared with 　　those who have less education, 59 percent of college graduates said they would like to use a driverless car compared with 38 percent of those with a high-school diploma or less. 
　　Where a person lives matters, too. More people who lives in cities and suburbs said they wanted to try driverless cars than those who lived in rural areas. 
　　While there's reason to believe that interest in self-driving cars is going up across the board, a person's age will have little to do with how self-driving cars can be becoming mainstream. Once driverless cares are actually available for safe, the early adopters will be the people who can afford to buy them. 

46.What happens when a new technology emerges? 
A.It further widens the gap between the old and the young. 
B.It often leads to innovations in other related fields. 
C.It contribute greatly to the advance of society as a whole. 
D.It usually draws different reactions from different age groups.
47.What does the author say about the driverless car? 
A.It does not seem to create a generational divide. 
B.It will not necessarily reduce road accidents. 
C.It may start a revolution in the car industry. 
D.It has given rise to unrealistic expectations. 
48.Why does the driverless car appeal to some old people? 
A.It saves their energy. 
B.It helps with their mobility. 
C.It adds to the safety of their travel. 
D.It stirs up their interest in life. 
49.What is likely to affect one's attitude toward the driverless car? 
A.The location of their residence. 
B.The amount of their special interest 
C.The amount of training they received. 
D.The length of their driving experience. 
50.Who are likely to be the first to buy the driverless car? 
A.The senior. 
B.The educated. 
C.The weaIthy. 
D.The tech fans.

　　Passage Two
　　In agrarian(农业的),pre-industrial Europe, "you'd want to wake up early, start working with the sunrise, have a break to have the largest meal, and then you'd go back to work," says Ken Albala, a professor of history at the University of the Pacific, "Later, at 5 or 6, you'd have a smaller supper."
　　This comfortable cycle, in which the rhythms of the day helped shape the rhythms of the meals, gave rise to the custom of the large midday meal, eaten with the extended family, "Meal are the foundation of the family,' says Carole Couniban. a professor at Millersville University in
　　Peensylvania, "so there was a very important interconnection between eating together" and strength-eating family ties.
　　Since industrialization, maintaining such a slow cultural metabolism has been much harder. With the long midday meal shrinking to whatever could be stuffed into a lunch bucket or bought at a food stand. Certainly, there were benefits. Modern techniques for producing and shipping food led to greater variety and quantity, including a tremendous, increase in the amount of animal protein and dairy products available, making us more vigorous than our ancestors.
　　Yet plenty has been lost too, even in cultures that still live to eat. Take Italy. It's no secret that the Mediterranean diet is healthy, but it was also a joy to prepare and cat. Italians, says Counihan, traditionally began the day with a small meal. The big meal came at around 1 p.m. In between the midday meal and a late, smaller dinner came a small snack. Today, when time zones have less and less meaning, there is little tolerance for offices' closing for lunch, and worsening traffic in cities means workers can't make it home and back fast enough anyway. So the formerly small supper after sundown becomes the big meal of the day. the only one at which the family has a chance to get together. "The evening meal carries the full burden that used to be spread over two meals" says Counihan.

51.What do we learn from the passage about people in pre-industrial Europe? 
A.They had to work from early morning till late at night. 
B.They were so busy working that they only ate simple meals. 
C.Their daily routine followed the rhythm of the natural cycle. 
D.Their life was much more comfortable than that of today. 
52.What does Professor Carole Counihan say about. pre-industrial European families eating meals together? 
A.It was helpful to maintaining a nation's tradition. 
B.It brought family members closers to each other. 
C.It was characteristic of the agrarian culture. 
D.It enabled families to save a lot of money. 
53.What does "cultural metabolism"(Line 1 ,Para. 3) refer to? 
A.Evolutionary adaptation. 
B.Changes in lifestyle. 
C.Social progress. 
D.Pace of life.
54.What does the author think of the food people eat today? 
A.Its quality is usually guaranteed. 
B.It is varied, abundant and nutritious. 
C.It is more costly than what our ancestors ate. 
D.Its production depends too much on technology. 
55.What does the author say about Italians of the old days. 
A.They enjoyed cooking as well as eating. 
B.They ate a big dinner late in the evening. 
C.They ate three meals regularly every day. 
D.They were expert at cooking meals.

Many men and women have long bought into the idea that there are “male” and “female” brains, believing that explains just about every difference between the sexes. A new study 26   that belief, questioning whether brains really can be distinguished by gender.
In the study, Tel Aviv University researchers 27  for sex differences the entire human brain.
And what did they find? Not much. Rather than offer evidence for 28  brains as “male” or “female,” research shows that brains fall into a wide range, with most people falling right in the middle.
Daphna Joel, who led the study, said her research found that while there are some gender-based 29  , many different types of brain can't always be distinguished by gender.
While the “average” male and “average” female brains were 30  different, you couldn't tell it by looking at individual brain scans. Only a small 31  of people had “all-male” or “all-female” characteristics.
Larry Cahill, an American neuroscientist（神经科学家）, said the study is an important addition to a growing body of research questioning 32  beliefs about gender and brain function. But he cautioned against concluding from this study that all brains are the same, 33  of gender.
“There's a mountain of evidence 34  the importance of sex influences at all levels of brain function,” he told The Seattle Times.
If anything, he said, the study 35  that gender plays a very important role in the brain “even when we are not clear exactly how.”

Section B
Directions:In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
Can Burglars Jam Your Wireless Security System?
[A]Any product that promises to protect your home deserves careful examination. So it isn't surprising that you'll find plenty of strong opinions about the potential vulnerabilities of popular home-security systems.
[B]The most likely type of burglary（入室盗窃）by far is the unsophisticated crime of opportunity, usually involving a broken window or some forced entry. According to the FBI, crimes like these accounted roughly two-thirds of all household burglaries in the US in 2013.The wide majority of the rest were illegal, unforced entries that resulted from something like a window being left open. The odds of a criminal using technical means to bypass a security system are so small that the FBI doesn't even track those statistics.
[C]One of the main theoretical home-security concerns is whether or not a given system is vulnerable to being blocked from working altogether. With wired setups, the fear is that a burglar（入室盗贼）might be able to shut your system down simply by cutting the right cable. With a wireless setup, you stick battery-powered sensors up around your home that keep an eye on windows, doors, motion, and more. If they detect something wrong while the system is armed, they'll transmit a wireless alert signal to a base station that will then raise the alarm. That approach will eliminate most cord-cutting concerns—but what about their wireless equivalent, jamming? With the right device tuned to the right frequency, what's to stop a thief from jamming your setup and blocking that alert signal from ever reaching the base station?
[D]Jamming concerns are nothing new, and they're not unique to security systems. Any device that's built to receive a wireless signal at a specific frequency can be overwhelmed by a stronger signal coming in on the same frequency. For comparison, let's say you wanted to “jam” a conversation between two people—all you'd need to do is yell in the listener's ear.
[E] Security devices are required to list the frequencies they broadcast on—that means that a potential thief can find what they need to know with minimal Googling. They will, however, need so know what system they're looking for. If you have a sign in your yard declaring what setup you use, that'd point them in the right direction, though at that point, we're talking about a highly targeted, semi-sophisticated attack, and not the sort forced-entry attack that makes up the majority of burglaries. It's easier to find and acquire jamming equipment for some frequencies than it is for others.
[F] Wireless security providers will often take steps to help combat the threat of jamming attacks. SimpliSafe, winner of our Editor's Choice distinction, utilizes a special system that's capable of separating incidental RF interference from targeted jamming attacks. When the system thinks it's being jammed, it'll notify you via push alert（推送警报）. From there, it's up to you to sound the alarm manually.
[G] SimpliSafe was singled out in one recent article on jamming, complete with a video showing the entire system being effectively bypassed with handheld jamming equipment. After taking appropriate measures to contain the RF interference to our test lab, we tested the attack out for ourselves, and were able to verify that it's possible with the right equipment. However, we also verified that SimpliSafe's anti-jamming system works. It caught us in the act, sent an alert to my smartphone, and also listed our RF interference on the system's event log. The team behind the article and video in question make no mention of the system, or whether or not in detected them.
[H]We like the unique nature of that software. It means that a thief likely wouldn't be able to Google how the system works, then figure out a way around it. Even if they could, SimpliSafe claims that its system is always evolving, and that it varies slightly from system to system, which means there wouldn't be a universal magic formula for cracking it. Other systems also seem confident on the subject of jamming. The team at Frontpoint addresses the issue in a blog on its site, citing their own jam protection software and claiming that there aren't any documented cases of successful jam attack since the company began offering wireless security sensors in the 1980s.
[I] Jamming attacks are absolutely possible. As said before, with the right equipment and the right know-how, it's possible to jam any wireless transmission. But how probable is it that someone will successfully jam their way into your home and steal your stuff?
[J] Let's imagine that you live in a small home with a wireless security setup that offers a functional anti-jamming system. First, a thief is going to need to target your home, specifically. Then, he's going to need to know the technical details of your system and acquire the specific equipment necessary for jamming your specific setup. Presumably, you keep your doors locked at night and while you're away. So the thief will still need to break in. That means defeating the lock somehow, or breaking a window. He'll need to be jamming you at this point, as a broken window or opened door would normally release the alarm. So, too, would the motion detectors in your home, so the thief will need to continue jamming once he's inside and searching for things to steal. However, he'll need to do so without tripping the anti-jamming system, the details of which he almost certainly does now have access to.
[K]At the end of the day, these kinds of systems are primarily designed to protect against the sort of opportunistic smash-and-grab attack that makes up the majority of burglaries. They're also only a single layer in what should ideally be a many-sided approach to securing your home, one that includes common sense things like sound locks and proper exterior lighting at night. No system is impenetrable, and none can promise to eliminate the worst case completely. Every one of them has vulnerabilities that a knowledgeable thief could theoretically exploit. A good system is one that keeps that worst-case setting as improbable as possible while also offering strong protection in the event of a less-extraordinary attack.
36. It is possible for burglars to make jamming attacks with the necessary equipment and skill.
37. Interfering with a wireless security system is similar to interfering with a conversation.
38. A burglar has to continuously jam the wireless security device to avoid triggering the alarm, both inside and outside the house.
39. SimpliSafe provides devices that are able to distinguish incidental radio interference from targeted jamming attacks.
40. Only a very small proportion of burglaries are committed by technical means.
41. It is difficult to crack SimpliSafe as its system keeps changing.
42. Wireless devices will transmit signals so as to activate the alarm once something wrong is detected.
43. Different measures should be taken to protect one's home from burglary in addition to the wireless security system.
44. SimpliSafe's device can send a warning to the house owner's cellphone.
45. Burglars can easily get a security device's frequency by Internet search.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A),B),C) and D).You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
As a person who writes about food and drink for a living. I couldn't tell you the first thing about Bill Perry or whether the beers he sells are that great. But I can tell you that I like this guy. That's because he plans to ban tipping in favor of paying his servers an actual living wage.
I hate tipping.
I hate it because it's an obligation disguised as an option. I hate it for the post-dinner math it requires of me. But mostly, I hate tipping because I believe I would be in a better place if pay decisions regarding employees were simply left up to their employers, as is the custom in virtually every other industry.
Most of you probably think that you hate tipping, too. Research suggests otherwise. You actually love tipping! You like to feel that you have a voice in how much money your server makes. No matter how the math works out, you persistently view restaurants with voluntary tipping systems as being a better value, which makes it extremely difficult for restaurants and bars to do away with the tipping system.
One argument that you tend to hear a lot from the pro-tipping crowd seems logical enough: the service is better when waiters depend on tips, presumably because they see a benefit to successfully veiling their contempt for you. Well, if this were true, we would all be slipping a few 100-dollar bills to our doctors on the way out their doors, too. But as it turns out, waiters see only a tiny bump in tips when they do an exceptional job compared to a passable one. Waiters, keen observers of humanity that they are, are catching on to this; in one poll, a full 30% said they didn't believe the job they did had any impact on the tips they received.
So come on, folks: get on board with ditching the outdated tip system. Pay a little more upfront for your beer or burger. Support Bill Perry's pub, and any other bar or restaurant that doesn't ask you to do drunken math.
46. What can we learn about Bill Perry from the passage?
A) He runs a pub that serves excellent beer.
B) He intends to get rid of the tipping practice.
C) He gives his staff a considerable sum for tips.
D) He lives comfortably without getting any tips.
47. What is the main reason why the author hates tipping?
A) It sets a bad example for other industries.
B) It adds to the burden of ordinary customers.
C) It forces the customer to compensate the waiter.
D) It poses a great challenge for customers to do math.
48. Why do many people love tipping according to the author?
A) They help improve the quality of the restaurants they dine in.
B) They believe waiters deserve such rewards for good service.
C) They want to preserve a wonderful tradition of the industry.
D) They can have some say in how much their servers earn.
49. What have some waiters come to realize according to a survey?
A) Service quality has little effect on tip size.
B) It is in human mature to try to save on tips.
C) Tips make it more difficult to please customers.
D) Tips benefit the boss rather that the employees.
50. What does the author argue for in the passage?
A) Restaurants should calculate the tips for customers.
B) Customers should pay more tips to help improve service.
C) Waiters deserve better than just relying on tips for a living.
D) Waiters should be paid by employers instead of customers.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
In the past, falling oil prices have given a boost to the world economy, but recent forecasts for global growth have been toned down, even as oil prices sink lower and lower. Does that mean the link between lower oil prices and growth has weakened?
Some experts say there are still good reasons to believe cheap oil should heat up the world economy. Consumers have more money in their pockets when they're paying less at the pump. They spend that money on other things, which stimulates the economy.
The biggest gains go to countries that import most of their oil like China, Japan, and India, But doesn't the extra money in the pockets of those countries' consumers mean an equal loss in oil producing countries, cancelling out the gains? Not necessarily, says economic researcher Sara Johnson. “Many oil producers built up huge reserve funds when prices were high, so when prices fall they will draw on their reserves to support government spending and subsidies(补贴)for their consumers.”
But not all oil producers have big reserves, In Venezuela, collapsing oil prices have sent its economy into free-fall.
Economist Carl Weinberg believes the negative effects of plunging oil prices are overwhelming the positive effects of cheaper oil. The implication is a sharp decline in global trade, which has plunged partly because oil-producing nations can't afford to import as much as they used to.
Sara Johnson acknowledges that the global economic benefit from a fall in oil prices today is likely lower than it was in the past. One reason is that more countries are big oil producers now, so the nations suffering from the price drop account for a larger share of the global economy.
Consumers, in the U.S. at least, are acting cautiously with the savings they're getting at the gas pump, as the memory of the recent great recession is still fresh in their mind. And a number of oil-producing countries are trimming their gasoline subsidies and raising taxes, so the net savings for global consumers is not as big as the oil price plunge might suggest.
51. What does the author mainly discuss in the passage?
A) The reasons behind the plunge of oil prices.
B) Possible ways to stimulate the global economy.
C) The impact of cheap oil on global economic growth.
D) The effect of falling oil prices on consumer spending.
52. Why do some experts believe cheap oil will stimulate the global economy?
A) Manufacturers can produce consumer goods at a much lower cost.
B) Lower oil prices have always given a big boost to the global economy.
C) Oil prices may rise or fall but economic laws are not subject to change.
D) Consumers will spend their saving from cheap oil on other commodities.
53. What happens in many oil-exporting countries when oil prices go down?
A) They suspend import of necessities from overseas.
B) They reduce production drastically to boost oil prices.
C) They use their money reserves to back up consumption.
D) They try to stop their economy from going into free-fall.
54. How does Carl Weinberg view the current oil price plunge?
A) It is one that has seen no parallel in economic history.
B) Its negative effects more than cancel out its positive effects.
C) It still has a chance to give rise to a boom in the global economy.
D) Its effects on the global economy go against existing economic laws.
55. Why haven't falling oil prices boosted the global economy as they did before?
A) People are not spending all the money they save on gas.
B) The global economy is likely to undergo another recession.
C) Oil importers account for a larger portion of the global economy.
D) People the world over are afraid of a further plunge in oil prices.

随着中国的改革开放，如今很多年轻人都喜欢举行西式婚礼。新娘在婚礼上穿着白色婚纱，因为白色被认为是纯洁的象征。然而在中国传统文化中，白色经常是葬礼上使用的颜色。因此务必记住，白花一定不要用作祝人康复的礼物，尤其不要送给老年人或危重病人。同样，礼金也不能装在白色的信封里，而要装在红色的信封里。

参考范文：Stated-owned business or Joint venture
　　Upon graduation, virtually all college students will confront the problem of the career choice，which is truly a tough choice. Students' opinions differ greatly on this issue. Some hold that there is no better way to get a decent job than working in a stated-owned business which will guarantee my life after retirement, but others take the attitude that a joint venture outweighs any other jobs as it may provide higher income for employees.
　　As to myself, I prefer the latter view. A joint venture, especially a high-salary joint venture, exerts a tremendous fascination on a great number of people, with no exception to me. Although it might be impossible to make sure my retirement pension is good enough, high-salary is exactly what I need just now. In my view, our career choices largely depend on where we want to stay for the rest of life. For me, metropolis is the place where I can grasp loads of opportunities and achieve my personal dreams. As I hold the view that live in the moment, not the future, and also in order to finance myself in some aspects such as the transportation, the house-renting, or social activities, a joint venture can satisfy my needs for the consumption I mentioned above.
　　In short, a joint venture is the first and only consideration in my choice of career.

　　Section A - 2
　　Rescue efforts were underway Thursday morning for 17 miners who were stuck in an elevator below ground at a Cargill rock salt mine near Lansing, New York, according to Marcia Lynch.
　　Public information officer with Tompkins County’s emergency response department, emergency workers have made contact with the miners via a radio. And they all appear to be uninjured, said Jessica Verfuss, the emergency department’s assistant director.
　　Crews have managed to provide heat packs and blankets to the miners so that they can keep warm during the rescue operation, Verfuss said. Details about what led to the workers’ being trapped in the elevator went immediately available. The mine, along New York’s Cayuga Lake, processes salt used for road treatment. It produces about 2 million tons of salt that is shipped to more than 1,500 places in the northeastern United States, the rock salt mine is one of three operated by Cargill with the other two in Louisiana and Ohio.

　　The U.S. Postal Service announced today that it is considering closing about 3,700 post offices over the next year because of falling revenues.
　　Facing an $8.3 billion budget deficit this year, closing post officers is one of several proposals the Postal Service has put forth recently to cut costs. Last week, for example, Postmaster General Pat Donahoe announced plans to stop mail delivery on Saturdays, a move he says could save $3 billion annually.
　　“We are losing revenue as we speak,” Donahoe said. “We do not want taxpayer money. We want to be self-sufficient. So like any other business you have to make choices.”
　　Dean Granholm the vice president for delivery and post office operations said the first waves of closings would begin this fall. He estimated that about 3,000 postmasters, 500 station managers and between 500 and 1,000 postal clerks could lose their jobs.

　　A: But the point is the man was clocked-in at 8 o'clock. We have John standing by the time clock, and he swears he saw nothing irregular.
　　B: Is John reliable?
　　A: Yes, he is. That's why we chose him for the job.
　　B: Have you spoken to the man who was late?
　　A: Not yet. I thought I'd have a word with you first. He's a difficult man, and I think there's been some trouble on the shop floor. I've got a feeling that trade union representative is behind this. The manager told me that Jack Green's been very active around the shop the last few days.
　　B: Well, what do you want me to do?
　　A: I was wondering if you'd see Smith, the man who was late, because you are so much better at handling things like this.
　　B: Oh, alright. I'll see him. I must say I agree with you about there being bad feelings in the works. I've had the idea for some time that Jack Green's been busy stirring things up in connection with the latest wage claim. He's always trying to make trouble. Well, I'll get the manager to send Smith up here.
　　Q8. What will happen to the press operator who was late for the work according to the woman?
　　Q9. What does the man say about John who stands by the time clock?
　　Q10. Why does the man suggest the woman see the worker who was late?
　　Q11. What does the woman say about Jack Green?
　　Conversation 2
　　A: Our topic today is about somethings that foreigners nearly always say when they visit Britain. It's 'Why are the British so cold?' And they're talking about the British personality – the famous British 'reserve'. It means that we aren't very friendly, we aren't very open.
　　B: So do you think it's true?
　　A: It's a difficult one. So many people who visit Britain say it's difficult to make friends with British people. They say we're cold, reserved, unfriendly...
　　B: I think it's true. Look at Americans or Australians. They speak the same language, but they're much more open. And you see it when you travel, people - I mean strangers - speak to you on the street or on the train. British people seldom speak on the train. Or the bus. Not in London, anyway.
　　A: 'Not in London'. That's it. Capital cities are full of tourists and are never very friendly. People are different in other parts of the country.
　　B: Not completely. I met a woman once, an Italian. She's been working in Manchester for two years,
　　and no one - not one of her colleagues - had ever invited her to their home. They were friendly to her at work, but nothing else. She couldn't believe it. She said that would never happen in Italy.
　　A: You know what they say – 'an Englishman's home is his castle'. It’s really difficult to get inside.
　　B: Yeah. It's about being private. You go home to your house and your garden and you close the door. It's your place.
　　A: That's why the British don't like flats. They prefer to live in houses.
　　B: That’s true.
　　Q12. What do foreigners generally think of British people according to the woman?
　　Q13. What may British people typically do one the train according to the man?
　　Q14. What does the man say about the Italian woman working in Manchester?
　　Q15. Why do British people prefer houses to flats?

　　Passage One
　　In college, time is scarce, and consequently, very precious. At the same time, expenses in college pile up surprisingly quickly. A part time job is a good way to balance costs while ensuring there is enough time left over for both academic subjects and after-class activities.
　　If you are a college student looking for a part time job, the best place to start your job search is right on campus. There are tons of on-campus job opportunities, and as a student, you’ll automatically be given hiring priority. Plus, on-campus jobs eliminate commuting time, and could be a great way to connect with academic and professional resources at your university. Check with your school’s career service or employment office for help to find a campus job. Of course, there are opportunities for part-time work off-campus, too. If you spend a little time digging for the right part time jobs, you’ll save yourself time when you find a job that leaves you with enough time to get your school work done, too. If you are a college student looking for work but worry you won’t have enough time to devote to academic subjects, consider working as a study hall or a library monitor. Responsibilities generally include supervising study spaces to ensure that a quiet atmosphere is maintained. It’s a pretty easy job, but one with lots of downtime-which means you will have plenty of time to catch up on reading, do homework or study for an exam.
　　Q16: What does the speaker say about college students applying for on-campus jobs?
　　Q17: What can students do to find a campus job according to the speaker?
　　Q18: What does the speaker say is a library monitor’s responsibility?
　　Passage Two
　　Agricultural workers in green tea fields near Mt. Kenya are gathering the tea leaves. It is beautiful to see. The rows of tea bushes are straight. All appears to be well. But the farmers who planted the bushes are worried. Nelson Kibara is one of them. He has been growing tea in the Kerugoya area for 40 years.
　　He says the prices this year have been so low that he has made almost no profit. He says he must grow different kinds of tea if he is to survive.
　　Mr. Kibara and hundreds of other farmers have been removing some of their tea bushes and planting a new kind of tea developed by the Tea Research Foundation of Kenya. Its leaves are purple and brown. When the tea is boiled, the drink has a purple color. Medical researchers have studied the health benefits of the new tea. They say it is healthier than green tea and could be sold for a price that is three to four times higher than the price of green tea.
　　But Mr. Kibara says he has not received a higher price for his purple tea crop.
　　He says the market for the tea is unstable and he is often forced to sell his purple tea for the same price as green tea leaves. He says there are not enough buyers willing to pay more for the purple tea.
　　Q19. Why have tea farmers in Kenya decided to grow purple tea?
　　Q20. What do researchers say about purple tea?
　　Q21. What does Mr. Kibara find about purple tea?
　　Passage Three
　　Today's consumers want beautiful handcrafted s to wear and to have for their home environment. They prefer something unique and they demand quality. Craftsmen today are meeting this demand. People and homes are showing great change as more and more unique handcrafted items become available. Handcrafts are big business. No long does a good craftsman have to work in a job he dislikes all day and then try to create at night. He has earned his professional status. He is now a respected member of society. Parts of the fun of being a craftsman is meeting other craftsmen. They love to share their ideas and materials and help others find markets for their work. Craftsmen have helped educate consumers to make wise choices. They help them become aware of design and technique. They help them relate their choice to its intended use. They often involve consumers in trying the craft themselves. When a group of craftsmen expends to include more members, a small craft organization is formed. Such an organization does a lot in training workshops in special media, craft marketing techniques, craft fairs and sales, festivals, TV appearances and demonstrations. State art councils help sponsor local arts and crafts festivals which draw crowds of tourist consumers. This boosts the local economy considerably because tourists not only buy crafts, but they also use the restaurants and hotels and other services of the area.
　　Q22. What does the speaker say about today's consumers?
　　Q23. What does the speaker say about a good craftsman in the past?
　　Q24. What do craftsmen help consumers do?
　　Q25. Why do state art councilshelp sponsor local arts and crafts festivals?

Part III Reading Comprehension (40 minutes)
　　Section A
　　26. E) challenge
　　空前主语为A new study，故此处应选一个动词第三人称单数作谓语，符合的词有E) challenges, M) suggests, 和 N) tastes，根据空后questioning，得出该空应填E) challenges 挑战，质疑。
　　27. J) searched
　　search for 为固定搭配，意为“寻找，搜索”，所给词汇中只有J) searched符合题意。
　　28. D) categorizing
　　空前是介词for，空后为名词brains，再根据后面的内容as “male” or “female”，初步判断该空应该填入动词的-ing形式。浏览选项，只有D)和H) 符合。根据搭配及语义，D)为答案，categorizing…as… 意为“把……分为……”。
　　29. K) similarities
　　根据空前的句子 “there are some gender-based…”，该空应填入名词复数形式。浏览选项，E), K), N)符合。再根据句意及空格后的句子“不同类型的大脑并不一直由性别区分”，该空应填入K) similarities “相似之处”。
　　30. L) slightly
　　空格前为be动词were，后为形容词different，很显然该空的词是来修饰different的，因此应填入副词。结合文意可知，虽然普通男性和普通女性的大脑差别很小，但是通过查看脑部扫描光片也没法对其进行区分。slightly为副词，意为“轻微地，稍微”，所以应填入L)。
　　31. G) percentage
　　空格前为形容词small，后为of people，因此应填入名词。结合文意可知，只有一小部分人具备“完全男性”或“完全女性”的特征。percentage意为“百分比”，a small percentage of…意为“一小部分”，所以应填入G)。
　　32. O) traditional
　　该空后为名词beliefs, 因此，该空应填入一个形容词，根据文意可知，很多研究都是在质疑“人们对于性别和大脑功能之间关系的传统理解”，因此，该处应选O) traditional传统的。
　　33. I)regardless
　　该空考查短语regardless of的含义。根据“他警告不要轻易给出以下结论：所有的大脑都是一样的，不论性别”可知，该空应填入I)regardless, 构成短语regardless of，意为“不管，不顾”。
　　34. H) proving
　　a mountain of evidence意为“大量的证据”，proving为现在分词作后置定语修饰evidence。
　　35. M) suggests
　　该句中，the study为主语，that引导的宾语从句作宾语，故此空应填入一个动词来作谓语，结合上下文，应选suggests，意为“暗示，表明”。

　　Section C
　　Passage One
　　46. [B] He intends to get rid of the tipping practice.
　　根据题目中的Bill Perry这个专有名词，我们可以定位到文中的第一段话。在But后面有提到“我能告诉你我喜欢这个小伙子。因为他打算禁止付小费这种情况，而赞成给服务员实际的工资”。B选项和这句话的含义接近，get rid of意为“摆脱”，和ban“禁止”含义相近;plan to和intend to含义一样。所以正确答案为B.
　　47. [C] It forces the customer to compensate the waiter.根据题干中的关键词the author hates tipping和main reason可以返回原文，定位到第三段。文中说“我讨厌它，因为它将义务伪装成一种选择。”既然是义务，那必然是强迫顾客去做的事情，这和C选项的含义较为接近。
　　48. [D] They can have some say in how much their servers earn.
　　根据关键词many people love tipping返回原文，我们可以定位至第四段。根据文中第二行的You like to feel that you have a voice in how much money your server makes.可知，这题应该选择D选项。
　　49. [A] Services quality has little effect on tip size.
　　文中问的是调查中一些服务员的观点，这在第五段的最后一句话中有所体现，文中说：一些服务员不认为他们的工作会受到收到的消费的影响。
　　50. [D] Waiters should be paid by employers instead of customers.
　　本题问作者的观点，切记文中无人认领的观点便是作者的观点。在第六段的末尾有提到说，作者支持Bill Perry的观点，而Bill的观点就和D选项是近义表达。
　　Passage Two
　　51. [C] The impact of cheap oil on global economic growth.
　　本题是主旨题，原文第一段表示“过去油价下降总是刺激世界经济增长，但是即使现在油价下降越来越多，最新对经济增长的预测却不容乐观，这意味着更低的油价和增长之间的关系削弱了吗?”这第一段点明了主题，后面的段落都是在讨论油价下降为什么以前可以刺激经济增长，而现在却不再能刺激经济增长了。可以看出是C是正确答案。
　　52. [D] Consumers will spend their savings from cheap oil on other commodities.
　　解析：根据原文第二段 “some experts say there are still good reasons to...They spend that money on other things, which stimulates the economy”，可以看出是D正确选项。

翻译原文：在中国文化中，红色通常象征着好运、长寿和幸福，在春节和其他喜庆场合，红色到处可见。人们把现金作为礼物送给家人或亲密朋友时，通常放在红信封里。红色在中国流行的另一个原因是人们把它与中国革命和共产党相联系。然而，红色并不总是代表好运与快乐。因为从前死者的名字常用红色书写，用红墨水写中国人名被看成是一种冒犯行为。
　　参考译文：
　　The color of red in Chinese culture usually means good luck, longevity and happiness. Red can be found everywhere during Chinese Spring Festival and other joyous occasions. Cashes often in red envelopes are sent to family members or close friends as gifts. Its popularity can also be attributed the fact that people accociate it with Chinese revolution and Communist Party. However, it does not always equal to good luck and joy in that the name of the dead used to be written in red. Using red ink to write names of Chinese people were seen as an offense.

The Blessing and Curse of the People Who Never Forget
A handful of people can recall almost every day of their lives in enormous detail—and after years of research, neuroscientists (神经科学专家) are finally beginning to understand how they do it.
[A] For most of us, memory is a mess of blurred and faded pictures of our lives. As much as we would like to cling on to our past, even the saddest moments can be washed away with time.
[B] Ask Nima Veiseh what he was doing for any day in the past 15 years, however, and he will give you the details of the weather, what he was wearing, or even what side of the train he was sitting on his journey to work. “My memory is like a library of video tapes, walk-throughs of every day of my life from waking to sleeping,” he explains.
[C] Veiseh can even put a date on when those tapes started recording: 15 December 2000, when he met his first girlfriend at his best friend's 16th birthday party. He had always had a good memory, but the thrill of young love seems to have shifted a gear in his mind: from now on, he would start recording his whole life in detail. “I could tell you everything about every day after that.”
[D] Needless to say, people like Veiseh are of great interest to neuroscientists hoping to understand the way the brain records our lives. A couple of recent papers have finally opened a window on these people’s extraordinary minds. And such research might even suggest ways for us all to relive our past with greater clarity.
[E] “Highly superior autobiographical memory”（or HSAM for short) first came to light in the early 2000s, with a young woman named Jill Price. Emailing the neuroscientist and memory researcher Jim McGaugh one day, she claimed that she could recall every day of her life since the age of 12. Could he help explain her experiences?
[F] McGaugh invited her to his lab, and began to test her: he would give her a date and ask her to tell him about the world events on that day. True to her word, she was correct almost every time.
[G] It didn’t take long for magazines and documentary film-makers to come to understand her “total recall”， and thank to the subsequent media interest, a few dozen other subjects (including Veiseh) have since come forward and contacted the team at the University of California, Irvine.
[H] Interestingly, their memories are highly self-centred: although they can remember “autobiographical” life events in extraordinary detail, they seem to be no better than average at recalling impersonal information, such as random (任意选取的）lists of words. Nor are they necessarily better at remembering a round of drinks, say. And although their memories are vast, they are still likely to suffer from “false memories”.Clearly, there is no such thing as a “perfect” memory—their extraordinary minds are still using the same flawed tools that the rest of us rely on. The question is, how?
[I] Lawrence Patihis at the University of Southern Mississippi recently studied around 20 people with HSAM and found that they scored particularly high on two measures: fantasy proneness (倾向)and absorption. Fantasy proneness could be considered a tendency to imagine and daydream, whereas absorption is the tendency to allow your mind to become fully absorbed in an activity to pay complete attention to the sensations (感受)and the experiences. “I’m extremely sensitive to sounds, smells and visual detail,” explains Nicole Donohue, who has taken part in many of these studies. “I definitely feel things more strongly than the average person.”
[J] The absorption helps them to establish strong foundations for recollection, says Patihis, and the fantasy proneness means that they revisit those memories again and again in the coming weeks and months. Each time this initial memory trace is “replayed”, it becomes even stronger. In some ways, you probably go through that process after a big event like your wedding day,but the difference is that thanks to their other psychological tendencies, the HSAM subjects are doing it day in, day out, for the whole of their lives.
[K] Not everyone with a tendency to fantasise will develop HSAM, though, so Patihis suggests that something must have caused them to think so much about their past. “Maybe some experience in their childhood meant that they became obsessed (着迷）with calendars and what happened to them,”says Patihis.
[L] The people with HSAM I’ve interviewed would certainly agree that it can be a mixed blessing. On the plus side, it allows you to relive the most transformative and enriching experiences. Veiseh, for instance, travelled a lot in his youth. In his spare time,he visited the local art galleries, and the paintings are now lodged deep in his autobiographical memories.
[M] “Imagine being able to remember every painting, on every wall, in every gallery space, between nearly 40 countries，” he says. “That’s a big education in art by itself.” With this comprehensive knowledge of the history of art, he has since become a professional painter.
[N] Donohue, now a history teacher, agrees that it helped during certain parts of her education. “I can definitely remember what I learned on certain days at school. I could imagine what the teacher was saying or what it looked like in the book.”
[O] Not everyone with HSAM has experienced these benefits, however. Viewing the past in high definition can make it very difficult to get over pain and regret. “It can be very hard to forget embarrassing moments,” says Donohue. “You feel the same emotions—it is just as raw, just as fresh... You can’t turn off that stream of memories, no matter how hard you try.” Veiseh agrees. “It is like having these open wounds—they are just a part of you,” he says.
[P] This means they often have to make a special effort to lay the past to rest. Bill, for instance, often gets painful “flashbacks”，in which unwanted memories intrude into his consciousness, but overall he has chosen to see it as the best way of avoiding repeating the same mistakes. “Some people are absorbed in the past but not open to new memories, but that’s not the case for me. I look forward to each day and experiencing something new.”
注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。
    36.People with HSAM have the same memory as ordinary people when it comes to impersonal information.
37.Fantasy proneness will not necessarily cause people to develop HSAM.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
The phrase almost completes itself: midlife crisis. It’s the stage in the middle of the journey when people feel youth vanishing, their prospects narrowing and death approaching.
There’s only one problem with the cliche (套话).It isn’t true.
“In fact, there is almost no hard evidence for midlife crisis other than a few small pilot studies conducted decades ago,” Barbara Hagerty writes in her new book, Life Reimagined. The vast bulk of the research shows that there may be a pause, or a shifting of gears in the 40s or 50s, but this shift “can be exciting, rather than terrifying”.
Barbara Hagerty looks at some of the features of people who turn midlife into a rebirth. They break routines, because “autopilot is death”. They choose purpose over happiness一having a clear sense of purpose even reduces the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. They give priority to relationships, as careers often recede(逐渐淡化).
Life Reimagined paints a picture of middle age that is far from gloomy. Midlife seems like the second big phase of decision-making. Your identity has been formed; you’ve built up your resources; and now you have the chance to take the big risks precisely because your foundation is already secure.
Karl Barth described midlife precisely this way. At middle age, he wrote, “the sowing is behind; now is the time to reap. The run has been taken; now is the time to leap. Preparation has been made; now is the time for the venture of the work itself.”
The middle-aged person, Barth continued, can see death in the distance, but moves with a “measured haste” to get big new things done while there is still time.
What Barth wrote decades ago is even truer today. People are healthy and energetic longer. We have presidential candidates running for their first term in office at age 68, 69 and 74. A longer lifespan is changing the narrative structure of life itself. What could have been considered the beginning of a descent is now a potential turning point—the turning point you are most equipped to take full advantage of.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
In spring, chickens start laying again, bringing a welcome source of protein at winter’s end. So it’s no surprise that cultures around the world celebrate spring by honoring the egg.
Some traditions are simple, like the red eggs that get baked into Greek Easter breads. Others elevate the egg into a fancy art, like the heavily jewel-covered “eggs” that were favored by the Russians starting in the 19th century.
One ancient form of egg art comes to us from Ukraine. For centuries, Ukrainians have been drawing complicated patterns on eggs. Contemporary artists have followed this tradition to create eggs that speak to the anxieties of our age: Life is precious, and delicate. Eggs are, too.
“There’s something about their delicate nature that appeals to me,” says New Yorker cartoonist Roz Chast. Several years ago, she became interested in eggs and learned the traditional Ukrainian technique to draw her very modem characters. “I’ve broken eggs at every stage of the process—from the very beginning to the very, very end.”
But there’s an appeal in that vulnerability. “There’s part of this sickening horror of knowing you’re walking on the edge with this, that I kind of like, knowing that it could all fall apart at any second.” Chast’s designs, such as a worried man alone in a tiny rowboat, reflect that delicateness.
Traditional Ukrainian decorated eggs also spoke to those fears. The elaborate patterns were believed to offer protection against evil.
“There’s an ancient legend that as long as these eggs are made, evil will not prevail in the world,” says Joan Brander, a Canadian egg-painter who has been painting eggs for over 60 years, having learned the art from her Ukrainian relatives.
The tradition, dating back to 300 B.C., was later incorporated into the Christian church. The old symbols, however, still endure. A decorated egg with a bird on it, given to a young married couple, is a wish for children. A decorated egg thrown into the field would be a wish for a good harvest.

One of Google's self-driving cars crashed into a bus in California last month. There were no injuries.
It is not the first time one of Google's famed self-driving cars has been involved in a crash, but it may be the first time it has caused one.
On February 14th the self-driving car, travelling at 2mph (3km/h), pulled out in front of a public bus going 15mph (24km/h).
The man in the Google vehicle reported that he assumed the bus would slow down to let the car out, and so he did not switch to the manual mode.
In a statement, Google said: "We clearly bear some responsibility, because if our car hadn't moved, there wouldn't have been a crash."
That said, our test driver believed the bus was going to slow or stop to allow us to merge into the traffic, and that there would be sufficient space to do that."
The company's self-driving cars have done well over a million miles across various states in the US, and until now have only reported minor accidents.
Q1: According to Google, what was the cause of the accident?

Long conversation 2
M: You know, Ben’s given up making those terrible faces he used to make. The other day, he came home from school almost in tears. His teacher said if he went on like that, his face would get stuck when the winds changed.
W: And he believed her?
M: Yeah, he’s only a little boy. Don’t you remember all those things we used to believe when we were little? I remember my aunt Mary used to say if you swallow a cherrystone, a tree would grow out of your mouth. And I’m still terrified today, sort of subconsciously. You know, if I swallow one by mistake…
W: Yeah, I suppose you're right. The one that used to get me was that swans could break your leg when they blow of the wing.
M: They can, can’t they? I always thought they could.
W: No, they are not that strong. But there’s another one even more terrifying. That is, if you put a post stamp on upside down, you will go to prison.
M: No, never heard of that. But my grandmother was a terror for that kind of thing. For example, she would say, you will get a spot on your tongue if you tell a lie. If you eat stale bread, your hair will curl. And here’s one more. We went on a campaign trip once in Italy, and my wife spent the whole time worrying about bats getting into her hair. She said her grandmother reckoned you had to shave your head to get it out. My wife was really terrified.

If I could go back in history and live when I liked, I wouldn't go back very far. In fact, I'd like to relive a period I've already lived – the 1960s.
I was in my twenties, and everything was being renewed. People would come in out of a formal and almost Victorian attitude, and you really felt anything was possible. Meeting people was the thing, and you went to coffee bars where you met friends and spent the evening. The cinema, the theater, all that was every exciting with new things coming out. In fact, we seemed to be out, all the time! I don't really remember working – of course, I was a student – or sitting around at home very much. That just wasn't where the scene was, even eating! It was the first time, ordinary people started going out to eat. We were beginning to be adventurous about food, but we were more interested in meeting people than in eating or drinking. And dress, yes, that was the revolution. I mean, girls went around in really short skirts, and wore flowers in their hair. And men were in jeans, and could wear their hair long too. It was a wonderful period. It was like living in an age you could never have imagined, and that never has come back. We didn't have much money, but it didn't matter. And there was plenty of opportunity to do whatever you felt like doing.
Question 16 – 18 are based on the passage you have just heard:
16. Why does the speaker say he would like to relive the 1960s?
17. What does the speaker say was the most popular thing to do at that time?
18. What do we learn about the speaker?

Dogs, man's best friends, have a clear strategy for dealing with angry owners—they look away.
New research shows that dogs limit their eye contact with angry humans. The scientists suggest this may be an attempt to calm humans down. This behavior may have evolved as dogs gradually learned they could benefit from avoiding conflicts with humans.
To conduct the tests, the University of Helsinki researchers trained 31 dogs to rest in front of a video screen. Facial photos of dogs and humans were displayed on the screen for 1.5 seconds. They showed threatening, pleasant and neutral expressions. Nearby cameras tracked the dogs' eye movements.
Dogs in the study looked most at the eyes of humans and other dogs to sense their emotions. When dogs looked at expressions of angry dogs, their eyes rested more on the mouth, perhaps to interpret the threatening expressions. And when looking at angry humans, they tended to turn away their gaze.
Dogs may have learned to detect threat signs from humans and respond by trying to make peace, according to researcher Sanni Somppi. Avoiding conflicts may have helped dogs develop better bonds with humans.
The researchers also note that dogs scan faces as a whole to sense how people are feeling, instead of focusing on a given feature. They suggest this indicates that dogs aren't sensing emotions from a single feature, but piecing together information from all facial features just as humans do.
Q19. What do dogs do when they are faced with angry humans?
Q20. What does a dog do when it sees the expressions of angry dogs?
Q21. How does a dog sense people's feelings?

Winter in many places is very cold. There is lots of snow around, and the ground freezes, which can make life difficult for animals. People in cold places live in warm houses and have learned to adapt. What do animals do? There are three main ways that animals survive the cold in winter: sleep, adapt or migrate.
Some animals, such as bears, frogs and snakes, sleep all winter. They sleep very deeply and need little or no food. While sleeping, their body temperature drops, and their heart beat slows down. To prepare for this before winter, these animals eat extra food to become fat, which gives them the energy they need while they sleep.
Other animals adapt. For example, by staying active in winter. It is often hard for them to find food. So some animals, such as mice, collect extra food before winter, and hide it. When winter comes, they return to their hiding places to eat the food. Some animals grow thicker fur, or live in tree holes or underground to stay warm.
Some birds migrate by flying to a warmer place for the winter, where they can find more food. Some fly very long distances, including one kind of bird that flies from the remote north of the world, all the way to the distant south. Some birds fly in groups for safety, while others fly alone.
Questions 22-25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
22. What does the speaker say about animals in winter?
23. What do we learn about animals that sleep through winter?
24. How do animals like mice adapt to the severe winter?
25. Why do some birds fly in groups when migrating, according to the speaker?

Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
 
From Accountant to Yogi: Making a Radical Career Change
[A] At some point, almost all of us will experience a period of radical professional change. Some of us will seek it out; for others it will feel like an unwelcome intrusion into otherwise stable careers. Either way, we have choices about how we respond to it when it comes.
[B] We recently caught up with yoga entrepreneur Leah Zaccaria, who put herself through the fire of change to completely reinvent herself. In her search to live a life of purpose, Leah left her high-paying accounting job, her husband, and her home, hi the process, she built a radically new life and career. Since then, she has founded two yoga studios, met a new life partner, and formed a new community of people. Even if your personal reinvention is less drastic, we think there are lessons from her experience that apply.
[C] Where do the seeds of change come from? the Native American Indians have a saying: “Pay attention to the whispers so you won’t have to hear the screams.” Often the best ideas for big changes come from unexpected places — it’s just a matter of tuning in. Great leaders recognize the weak signals or slight signs that point to big changes to come. Leah reflects on a time she listened to the whispers: “About the time my daughter was five years old. I started having a sense that ‘this isn’t right.”’ She then realized that her life no longer matched her vision for it.
[D] Up until that point, Leah had followed traditional measures of success. After graduating with a degree in business and accounting, she joined a public accounting firm, married, bought a house, put lots of stuff in it, and had a baby. “I did what everybody else thought looked successful,” she says. Leah easily could have fallen into a trap of feeling content; instead, her energy sparked a period of experimentation and renewal.
[E] Feeling the need to change, Leah started playing with future possibilities by exploring her interests and developing new capabilities. First trying physical exercise and dieting, she lost some weight and discovered an inner strength. “1 felt powerful because 1 broke through my own limitations,” she recalls.
[F] However, it was another interest that led Leah to radically reinvent herself. “I remember sitting on a bench with my aunt at a yoga studio,’’ she said, having a moment of clarity right then and there: Yoga is saving my life. Yoga is waking me up. I’m not happy and I want to change and I’m done with this.” In that moment of clarity Leah made an important leap,conquering her inner resistance to change and making a firm commitment to take bigger steps.
[G] Creating the future you want is a lot easier if you are ready to exploit the opportunities that come your way. When Leah made the commitment to change, she primed herself to new opportunities she may otherwise have overlooked. She recalls:
[H] One day a man I worked with, Ryan, who had his office next to mine, said, “Leah, let’s go look at this space on Queen Anne.” He knew my love for yoga and had seen a space close to where he lived that he thought might be good to serve as a yoga studio. As soon as I saw the location, I knew this was it. Of course I was scared, yet I had this strong sense of “I have to do this.” Only a few months later Leah opened her first yoga studio, but success was not instant.
[I] Creating the future takes time. That’s why leaders continue to manage the present while building toward the big changes of the future. When it’s time to make the leap, they take action and immediately drop what’s no longer serving their purpose. Initially Leah stayed with her accounting job while starting up the yoga studio to make it all work.
[J] Soon after, she knew she had to make a bold move to fully commit to her new future. Within two years, Leah shed the safety of her accounting job and made the switch complete. Such drastic change is not easy.
[K] Steering through change and facing obstacles brings us face to face with our fears. Leah reflects on one incident that triggered her fears, when her investors threatened to shut her down: “I was probably up against the most fear I’ve ever had，” she says. “I had spent two years cultivating this community, and it had become successful very fast, but within six months I was facing the prospect of losing it all.”
[L] She connected with her sense of purpose and dug deep, cultivating a tremendous sense of strength. “I was feeling so intentional and strong that I wasn’t going to let fear just take over. I was thinking, ‘OK, guys, if you want to try to shut me down, shut me down.’And I knew it was a negotiation scheme, so I was able to say to myself, ‘This is not real.’” By naming her fears and facing them head-on, Leah gained confidence. For most of us, letting go of the safety and security of the past gives us great fear. Calling out our fears explicitly, as Leah did,can help us act decisively.
[M] The cycle of renewal never ends. Leah’s growth spurred her to open her second studio— and it wasn’t for the money.
[N] I have no desire to make millions of dollars. It’s not about that; it’s about growth for me. Honestly, I didn’t need to open a second studio. I was making as much money as I was as an accountant. But I know if you don’t grow, you stand still, and that doesn’t work for me.
[O] Consider the current moment in your own life, your team or your organization. Where are you in the cycle of renewal: Are you actively preserving the present, or selectively forgetting the past, or boldly creating the future? What advice would Leah give you to move you ahead on your journey? Once we’re on the path of growth, we can continually move through the seasons of transformation and renewal.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
The Urbanization — migration away from the suburbs to the city center — will be the biggest real estate trend in 2015, according to a new report.
The report says America’s urbanization will continue to be the most significant issue affecting the industry, as cities across the country imitate the walkability and transit-oriented development making cities like New York and San Francisco so successful.
As smaller cities copy the model of these “24-hour cities，’’ tfiore affordable versions of these places will be created. The report refers to this as the coming of the “18-hour city，”，and uses the term to refer to cities like Houston, Austin, Charlotte, and Nashville, which are “positioning themselves as highly competitive, in terms of livability, employment offerings, and recreational and cultural facilities.” 
Another trend that looks significant in 2015 is that America’s largest population group, Millennials (千禧一代)，will continue to put off buying a house. Apartments will retain their appeal for a while for Millennials, haunted by what happened to home-owning parents.
This trend will continue into the 2020s, the report projects. After that, survey respondents disagree over whether this generation will follow in their parents，footsteps, moving to the suburbs to raise families, or will choose to remain in the city center.
Another issue affecting real estate in the coming year will be America’s failing infrastructure. Most roads, bridges, transit, water systems, the electric grid, and communications networks were installed 50 to 100 years ago, and they are largely taken for granted until they fail.
The report’s writers state that America’s failure to invest in infrastructure impacts not only the health of the real-estate market, but also our ability to remain globally competitive.
Apart from the specific trends highlighted above, which cause some investors to worry, the report portrays an overall optimism borne by the recent healthy real-estate “upcycle” and improving economy. Seventy-four percent of the respondents surveyed report a “good to excellent” expectation of real-estate profitability in 2015. While excessive optimism can promote bad investment patterns, resulting in a real- estate “bubble,” the report’s writers downplay that potential outcome in that it has not yet occurred.

       A)	an accelerating speed
B) a shift to city centers
   C) a new focus on small cities

47.	What characterizes “24-hour cities” like New York?
       A)	People can live without private cars.
       B)	People are generally more competitive.
       C)	People can enjoy services around the clock.
       D)	People are in harmony with the environment.

48. Why are Millennials reluctant to buy a house?
       A)	They can only afford small apartments.
       B)	The house prices are currently too high.
       C) Their parents' bad experience still haunts them.
       D) They feel attached to the suburban environment.

49.	What might hinder real estate development in the U.S.?
       A)	The continuing economic recession in the country.
       B)	The lack of confidence on the part of investors.
       C)	The fierce global competition.
       D)	The worsening infrastructure.

50.	How do most of the respondents in the survey feel about the U.S. real-estate market in 2015?
       A) Pessimistic.	                B) Hopeful.
       C)	Cautious.	                D) Uncertain.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
The brain is a seemingly endless library, whose shelves house our most precious memories as well as our lifetime’s knowledge. But is there a point where it reaches capacity?
The answer is no, because brains are more sophisticated than that. Instead of just crowding in, old information is sometimes pushed out of the brain for new memories to form.
Previous behavioural studies have shown that learning new information can lead to forgetting. But in a new study, researchers demonstrated for the first time how this effect occurs in the brain.
In daily life, forgetting actually has clear advantages. Imagine, for instance, that you lost your bank card. The new card you receive will come with a new personal identificatipn number (PIN). Each time you remember the new PIN, you gradually forget the old one. This process improves access to relevant information, without old memories interfering.
And most of us may sometimes feel the frustration of having old memories interfere with new, relevant memories. Consider trying to remember where you parked your car in the same car park you were at a week earlier. This type of memory (where you are trying to remember new, but similar information) is particularly vulnerable to interference.
When we acquire new information, the brain automatically tries to incorporate (合并)it within existing information by forming associations. And when we retrieve (检索) information, both the desired and associated but irrelevant information is recalled.,
The majority of previous research has focused on how we learn and remember new information. But current studies are beginning to place greater emphasis on the conditions under which we forget, as its importance begins to be more appreciated.
A very small number of people are able to remember almost every detail of their life. While it may sound like an advantage to many, people with this rare condition often find their unusual ability burdensome.
In a sense, forgetting is our brain’s way of sorting memories, so the most relevant memories are ready for retrieval. Normal forgetting may even be a safety mechanism to ensure our brain doesn’t become too full.

51.	What have past behavioural studies found about our brain?
    A)	Its capacity actually knows no limits.
    B)	It grows sophisticated with practice.
    C)	It keeps our most precious memories until life’s end.
D)	New information learned pushes old information out. 

52.	What is the benefit of forgetting?
    A)	It frees us from painful memories.
    B)	It helps slow down our aging process.
    C)	It facilitates our access to relevant information.
D)	It prevents old information from forming associations.

53.	What is the emphasis of current studies of memory?
    A)	When people tend to forget.
    B)	What contributes to forgetting.
    C)	How new technology hinders memory capacity.
D)	Why learning and forgetting arc complementary.

54.	What do people find about their rare ability to remember every detail of their life?
    A)	It adds to the burden of their memory.
    B)	It makes their life more complicated.
    C)	It contributes to their success in life.
D)	It constitutes a rare object of envy.

55. What does the passage say about forgetting?
    A)	It can enlarge our brain capacity.
    B)	It helps get rid of negative memories.
    C)	It is a way of organising our memories.
    D)	It should not cause any alarm in any way.

Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
 
Team spirit
[A] Teams have become the basic building blocks of organizations. Recruitment advertisements routinely call for “team players”. Business schools grade their students in part on their performance in group projects. Office managers knock down walls to encourage team building. Teams are as old as civilization, of course: even Jesus had 12 co-workers. But a new report by Deloitte, “Global Human Capital Trends”, based on a survey of more than 7,000 executives in over 130 countries, suggests that the fashion for teamwork has reached a new high. Almost half of those surveyed said their companies were either in the middle of restructuring or about to embark on (开始）it; and for the most part, restructuring meant putting more emphasis on teams.
[B] Companies are abandoning conventional functional departments and organising employees into cross-disciplinary teams that focus on particular products, problems or customers. These teams are gaining more power to run their own affairs. They are also spending more time working with each other rather than reporting upwards. Deloitte argues that a new organisational form is on the rise: a network of teams is replacing the conventional hierarchy (等级体制).
[C] The fashion for teams is driven by a sense that the old way of organising people is too rigid for both the modem marketplace and the expectations of employees. Technological innovation places greater value on agility (灵活性).John Chambers, chairman of Cisco Systems Inc., a worldwide leader in electronics products, says that “we compete against market transitions (过渡)，not competitors. Product transitions used to take five or seven years; now they take one or two. ” Digital technology also makes it easier for people to co-ordinate their activities without resorting to hierarchy. The “millennials” (千禧一代) who will soon make up half the workforce in rich countries were raised from nursery school onwards to work in groups.
[D] The fashion for teams is also spreading from the usual corporate suspects (such as GE and IBM) to some more unusual ones. The Cleveland Clinic, a hospital operator, has reorganised its medical staff into teams to focus on particular treatment areas; consultants, nurses and others collaborate closely instead of being separated by speciality (专业)and rank. The US Army has gone the same way. In his book, “Team of Teams' General Stanley McChrystal describes how the army’s hierarchical structure hindered its operations during the early stages of the Iraq war. His solution was to learn something from the insurgents it was fighting: decentralise authority to self-organising teams.
[E] A good rule of thumb is that as soon as generals and hospital administrators jump on a management bandwagon, it is time to ask questions. Leigh Thompson of Kellogg School of Management in Illinois warns that, ‘Teams are not always the answer—teams may provide insight, creativity and knowledge in a way that a person working independently cannot; but teamwork may also lead to confusion, delay and poor decision-making.” The late Richard Hackman of Harvard University once argued, “I have no question that when you have a team, the possibility exists that it will generate magic, producing something extraordinary... But don’t count on it.”
[F] Hackman (who died in 2013) noted that teams are hampered by problems of co-ordination and motivation that chip away at the benefits of collaboration. High-flyers forced to work in teams may be undervalued and free-riders empowered. Groupthink may be unavoidable. In a study of 120 teams of senior executives, he discovered that less than 10% of their supposed members agreed on who exactly was on the team. If it is hard enough to define a team’s membership, agreeing on its purpose is harder still.
[G] Profound changes in the workforce are making teams trickier to manage. Teams work best if their members have a strong common culture. This is hard to achieve when, as is now the case in many big firms, a large proportion of staff are temporary contractors. Teamwork improves with time: America’s National Transportation Safety Board found that 73% of the incidents in its civil-aviation database occurred on a crew’s first day of flying together. However, as Amy Edmondson of Harvard points out, organisations increasingly use “team” as a verb rather than a noun: they form teams for specific purposes and then quickly disband them.
[H] The least that can be concluded from this research is that companies need to think harder about managing teams. They need to rid their minds of sentimentalism (感情用事)：the most successful teams have leaders who are able to set an overall direction and take immediate action. They need to keep teams small and focused: giving in to pressure to be more “inclusive” is a guarantee of dysfunction. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s boss, says that “If I see more than two pizzas for lunch, the team is too big.” They need to immunize teams against group-think: Hackman argued that the best ones contain “deviants” (离经叛道者）who are willing to do something that maybe upsetting to others.
[I] A new study of 12,000 workers in 17 countries by Steelcase, a furniture-maker which also does consulting, finds that the best way to ensure employees are “engaged” is to give them more control over where and how they do their work―which may mean liberating them from having to do everything in collaboration with others.
[J] However, organisations need to learn something bigger than how to manage teams better: they need to be in the habit of asking themselves whether teams are the best tools for the job. Teambuilding skills are in short supply: Deloitte reports that only 12% of the executives they contacted feel they understand the way people work together in networks and only 21% feel confident in their ability to build cross-functional teams. Loosely managed teams can become hotbeds of distraction―employees routinely complain that they can’t get their work done because they are forced to spend too much time in meetings or compelled to work in noisy offices. Even in the age of open-plan offices and social networks some work is best left to the individual.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
The Shoppers in the UK are spending less money on toilet paper to save money, research has shown.
Penny-pinching UK consumers choose cheaper products from discounters such as Aldi and Lidl rather than luxury alternatives.
This has wiped 6% off the value of the soft tissue paper market in the UK. It has shrunk from £1.19 billion in 2011 to £1.12 billion in 2015,according to a new report from market research company Mintel. Furthermore, the future of the market looks far from rosy, with sales expected to fall further to £1.11 billion in 2016.
In the last year alone, despite an increase in the UK population and a subsequent rise in the number of households, sales of toilet paper fell by 2%, with the average household reducing their toilet roll spending from £43 in 2014 to £41 in 2015.
Overall, almost three in five people say they try to limit their usage of paper—including facial tissue and kitchen roll―to save money. “Strength，softness and thickness remain the leading indicators of toilet paper quality, with just a small proportion of consumers preferring more luxurious alternatives, such as those with flower patterns of perfume,said Mintel analyst Jack Duckett. ''These extra features are deemed unnecessary by the majority of shoppers, which probably reflects how these types of products are typically more expensive than regular toilet paper, even when on special offer.”
While consumers are spending less on toilet paper, they remain fussy―in theory at least—when it comes to paper quality. Top of Britons’ toilet paper wish list is softness (57%) followed by strength (45%) and thickness (36%).
One in 10 buyers rand toilet rolls made from recycled paper among their top considerations, highlighting how overall the environment is much less of a consideration for shoppers than product quality. In a challenge for manufacturers, 81% of paper product users said they would consider buying recycled toilet tissue if it were comparable in quality to standard paper.

46.	The market sales of toilet paper have decreased because	.
A)	Britons have cut their spending on it
B)	its prices have gone up over the years
C)	its quality has seen marked improvement
D)	Britons have developed the habit of saving

47.	What does the author think of the future of the tissue paper market in the UK?
A)	It will expend in time.
B)	It will remain gloomy.
C)	It will experience ups and downs.
D)	It will recover as population grows.

48.	What does Jack Duckett say about toilet paper?
A)	Special offers would promote its sales.
B)	Consumers are loyal to certain brands.
C)	Luxurious features add much to the price.
D)	Consumers have a variety to choose from.

49.  What do we learn about Britons concerning toilet paper?
A)	They are particular about the quality of toilet paper.
B)	They emphasize the strength of toilet paper the most.
C)	They prefer cheap toilet paper to recycled toilet paper.
D)	They reject using toilet paper with unnecessary features.

50.  What can we infer from the last paragraph?
A)	More and more Britons buy recycled toiler paper to protect the environment.
B)	Toilet paper manufacturers are facing a great challenge in promoting its sales.
C)	Toilet paper manufacturers compete with one another to improve product quality.
D)	Environmental protection is not much of a concern when Britons buy toilet paper.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
“One of the reasons I find this topic very interesting is because my mom was a smoker when I was younger，” says Lindson-Hawley, who studies tobacco and health at the University of Oxford.
By studying about 700 adult smokers, she found out that her mom quit the right way—by stopping abruptly and completely.
In her study, participants were randomly (随机地）assigned to two groups. One had to quit abruptly on a given day, going from about a pack a day to zero. The other cut down gradually over the course of two weeks. People in both groups used nicotine (尼古丁）patches before they quit, in addition to a second form of nicotine replacement, like gum or spray. They also had talk therapy with a nurse before and after quit day.
Six months out, more people who had quit abruptly had stuck with it—more than one-fifth of them, compared to about one-seventh in the other group. Although these numbers appear low, it is much higher than if people try without support.
And the quit rates were particularly convincing given that before the study started, most of the people had said they’d rather cut down gradually before quitting. “If you’re training for a marathon, you wouldn’t expect to turn up and just be able to run it. And I think people see that for smoking as well. They think,‘ Well， if I gradually reduce, it’s like practice，’” says Lindson-Hawley. But that wasn’t the case. Instead of giving people practice, the gradual reduction likely gave them cravings (瘾）and withdrawal symptoms before they even reached quit day, which could be why fewer people in that group actually made it to that point. “Regardless of your stated preference, if you’re ready to quit, quitting abruptly is more effective,”says Dr. Gabriela Ferreira. “When you can quote a specific number like a fifth of the patients were able to quit, that’s compelling. It gives them the encouragement, I think, to really go for it，’’Ferreira says.
People rarely manage to quit the first time they try. But at least, she says, they can maximize the odds of success.

    B)	They were looked after by physicians.
    C)	They were encouraged by psychologists.
D)	They were offered nicotine replacements.

53. How does Dr. Gabriela Ferreira view the result of Lindson-Hawley’s experiment?

　Part Ⅲ Reading Comprehension ( 40 minutes )
　　Section A
　　Directions: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.
　　A rat or pigeon might not be the obvious choice to tend to someone who is sick, but these creatures have some 26 skills that could help the treatment of human diseases.
　　Pigeons are often seen as dirty birds and an urban 27 , but they are just the latest in a long line of animals that have been found to have abilities to help humans. Despite having a brain no bigger than the 28 of your index finger, pigeons have a very impressive 29__ memory. Recently it was shown that they could be trained to be as accurate as humans at detecting breast cancer in images.
　　Rats are often 30 with spreading disease rather than 31 it, but this long-tailed animal is highly 32 . Inside a rat's nose are up to 1,000 different types of olfactory receptors (嗅觉感受器), whereas humans only have 100 to 200 types. This gives rats the ability to detect __33 smells. As a result, some rats are being put to work to detect TB(肺结核). When the rats detect the smell, they stop and rub their legs to 34 a sample is infected.
　　Traditionally, a hundred samples would take lab technicians more than two days to 35 , but for a rat it takes less than 20 minutes. This rat detection method doesn't rely on specialist equipment. It is also more accurate — the rats are able to find more TB infections and, therefore, save more lives.
 
　Section B
　　Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
　　Do In-Class Exams Make Students Study Harder?
　　Research suggests they may study more broadly for the unexpected rather than search for answers.
　　[A] I have always been a poor test-taker. So it may seem rather strange that I have returned to college to finish the degree I left undone some four decades ago. I am making my way through Columbia University, surrounded by students who quickly supply the verbal answer while I am still processing the question.
　　[B] Since there is no way for me to avoid exams, I am currently questioning what kind are the most taxing and ultimately beneficial. I have already sweated through numerous in-class midterms and finals, and now I have a professor who issues take-home ones. I was excited when I learned this, figuring I had a full week to do the research, read the texts, and write it all up. In fact, I was still rewriting my midterm the morning it was due. To say I had lost the thread is putting it mildly.
　　[C] As I was suffering through my week of anxiety, overthinking the material and guessing my grasp of it, I did some of my own polling among students and professors. David Eisenbach, who teaches a popular class on U.S. presidents at Columbia, prefers the in-class variety. He believes students ultimately learn more and encourages them to form study groups. “That way they socialize over history outside the class, which wouldn’t happen without the pressure of an in-class exam,” he explained, “Furthermore, in-class exams force students to learn how to perform under pressure, and essential work skill.”
　　[D] He also says there is less chance of cheating with the in-class variety. In 2012, 125 students at Harvard were caught up in a scandal when it was discovered they had cheated on a take-home exam for a class entitled “Introduction To Congress.” Some colleges have what they call an “honor code,” though if you are smart enough to get into these schools, you are either smart enough to get around any codes or hopefully, too ethical to consider doing so. As I sat blocked and clueless for two solid days, I momentarily wondered if I couldn’t just call an expert on the subject matter which I was tackling, or someone who took the class previously, to get me going.
　　[E] Following the Harvard scandal, Mary Miller, the former dean of students at Yale, made an impassioned appeal to her school’s professors to refrain from take-hone exams. “Students risk health and well being, as well as performance in other end-of-term work, when faculty offers take-home exams without clear, time-limited boundaries,” she told me. “Research now shows that regular quizzes, short essays, and other assignments over the course of a term better enhance learning and retention.”
　　[F] Most college professors agree the kind of exam they choose largely depends on the subject. A quantitative-based one, for example, is unlikely to be sent home, where one could ask their older brothers and sisters to help. Vocational-type classes, such as computer science or journalism, on the other hand, are often more research-oriented and lend themselves to take-home testing. Chris Koch, who teaches “History of Broadcast Journalism” at Montgomery Community College in Rockville, Maryland, points out that reporting is about investigation rather than the memorization of minute details. “In my field, it’s not what you know—it’s what you know how to find out,” says Koch. “There is way too much information, and more coming all the time, for anyone to remember. I want my students to search out the answers to questions by using all the resources available to them.
　　[G] Students’ test-form preferences vary, too, often depending on the subject and course difficulty. “I prefer take-home essays because it is then really about the writing, so you have time to edit and do more research,” says Elizabeth Dresser, a junior at Barnard. Then there is the stress factor. Francesca Haass, a senior at Middlebury, says, “I find the in-class ones are more stressful in the short term, but there is immediate relief as you swallow information like mad, and then you get to forget it all. Take-homes require thoughtful engagement which can lead to longer term stress as there is never a moment when the time is up.” Meanwhile, Olivia Rubin, a sophomore at Emory, says she hardly even considers take-homes true exams. “If you understand the material and have the ability to articulate (说出) your thoughts, they should be a breeze.”
　　[H] How students ultimately handle stress may depend on their personal test-taking abilities. There are people who always wait until the last minute, and make it much harder than it needs to be. And then there those who, not knowing what questions are coming at them, and having no resources to refer to, can freeze. And then there are we rare folks who fit both those descriptions.
　　[I] Yes, my advanced age must factor into the equation (等式), in part because of my inability toaccess the information as quickly. As another returning student at Columbia, Kate Marber, toldme, “We are learning not only all this information, but essentially how to learn again. Ourfellow students have just come out of high school. A lot has changed since we were last inschool.”
　　[J] If nothing else, the situation has given my college son and me something to share, When Iasked his opinion on this matter, he responded, “I like in-class exams because the time isalready reserved, as opposed to using my free time at home to work on a test,” he responded.It seems to me that a compromise would be receiving the exam questions a day or two inadvance, and then doing the actual test in class the ticking clock overhead.
　　[K] Better yet, how about what one Hunter College professor reportedly did recently for her finalexam: She encouraged the class not to stress or even study, promising that, “It is going to be apiece of cake.” When the students came in, sharpened pencils in hand, there was not a bluebook in sight. Rather, they saw a large chocolate cake and they each were given a slice.
　　36. Elderly students find it hard to keep up with the rapid changes in education.
　　37. Some believe take-home exams may affect students' performance in other courses.
　　38. Certain professors believe in-class exams are ultimately more helpful to students.
　　39. In-class exams are believed to discourage cheating in exams.
　　40. The author was happy to learn she could do some exams at home.
　　41. Students who put off their work until the last moment often find the exams more difficult than
　　they actually are.
　　42. Different students may prefer different types of exams.
　　43. Most professors agree whether to give an in-class or a take-home exam depends on type of
　　course being taught.
　　44. The author dropped out of college some forty years ago.
　　45. Some students think take-home exams will eat up their free time.
Section C
　　Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
　　Passage One
　　Questions 46 and 50 are based on the following passage.
　　That people often experience trouble sleeping in a different bed in unfamiliar surroundings is a phenomenon known as the “first-night” effect. If a person stays in the same room the following night they tend to sleep more soundly. Yuka Sasaki and her colleagues at Brown University set out to investigate the origins of this effect.
　　Dr. Sasaki knew the first-night effect probably has something to do with how humans evolved. The puzzle was what benefit would be gained from it when performance might be affected the following day. She also knew from previous work conducted on birds and dolphins that these animals put half of their brains to sleep at a time so that they can rest while remaining alert enough to avoid predators (捕食者). This led her to wonder if people might be doing the same thing. To take a closer look, her team studied 35 healthy people as they slept in the unfamiliar environment of the university’s Department of Psychological Sciences. The participants each slept in the department for two nights and were carefully monitored with techniques that looked at the activity of their brains. Dr. Sasaki found, as expected, the participants slept less well on their first night than they did on their second, taking more than twice as long to fall asleep and sleeping less overall. During deep sleep, the participants’ brains behaved in a similar manner seen in birds and dolphins. On the first night only, the left hemispheres (半球) of their brains did not sleep nearly as deeply as their right hemispheres did.
　　Curious if the left hemispheres were indeed remaining awake to process information detected in the surrounding environment, Dr. Sasaki re-ran the experiment while presenting the sleeping participants with a mix of regularly timed beeps (蜂鸣声) of the same tone and irregular beeps of a different tone during the night. She worked out that, if the left hemisphere was staying alert to keep guard in a strange environment, then it would react to the irregular beeps by stirring people from sleep and would ignore the regularly timed ones. This is precisely what she found.
　　46. What did researchers find puzzling about the first-night effect?
　　A) To what extent it can trouble people. C) What circumstances may trigger it.
　　B) What role it has played in evolution. D) In what way it can be beneficial.
　　47. What do we learn about Dr. Yuka Sasaki doing her research?
　　A) She found birds and dolphins remain alert while asleep.
　　B) She found birds and dolphins sleep in much the same way.
　　C) She got some idea from previous studies on birds and dolphins
　　D) She conducted studies on birds’ and dolphins’ sleeping patterns.
　　48. What did Dr. Sasaki do when she first did her experiment?
　　A) She monitored the brain activity of participants sleeping in a new environment.
　　B) She recruited 35 participants from her Department of Psychological Sciences.
　　C) She studied the differences between the two sides of participants’ brains.
　　D) She tested her findings about birds and dolphins on human subjects.
　　49. What did Dr. Sasaki do when re-running her experiment?
　　A) She analyzed the negative effect of irregular tones on brains.
　　B) She recorded participants’ adaptation to changed environment.
　　C) She exposed her participants to two different stimuli.
　　D) She compared the responses of different participants.
　　50. What did Dr. Sasaki find about the participants in her experiment?
　　A) They tended to enjoy certain tones more than others.
　　B) They tended to perceive irregular beeps as a threat.
　　C) They felt sleepy when exposed to regular beeps.
　　D) They differed in their tolerance of irregular tones.
　　Passage Two
　　Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　It’s time to reevaluate how women handle conflict at work. Being overworked or over-committed at home and on the job will not get you where you want to be in life. It will only slow you down and hinder your career goals.
　　Did you know women are more likely than men to feel exhausted? Nearly twice as many women than men ages 18-44 reported feeling “very tired” or “exhausted”, according to a recent study.
　　This may not be surprising given that this is the age range when women have children. It's also the age range when many women are trying to balance careers and home. One reason women may feel exhausted is that they have a hard time saying "no." Women want to be able todo it all volunteer for school parties or cook delicious meals-and so their answer to any request is often “Yes, I can.”
　　Women struggle to say “no” in the workplace for similar reasons, including the desire to be liked by their colleagues. Unfortunately, this inability to say "no" may be hurting women's heath as well as their career.
　　At the workplace, men use conflict as a way to position themselves, while women often avoid conflict or strive to be the peacemaker, because they don't want to be viewed as aggressive or disruptive at work. For example, there’s a problem that needs to be addressed immediately, resulting in a dispute over should be the one to fix it. Men are more likely to face that dispute from the perspective of what benefits them most, whereas women may approach the same dispute from the perspective of what's the easiest and quickest way to resolve the problem-even
　　if that means doing the boring work themselves.
　　This difference in handling conflict could be the deciding factor on who gets promoted to a leadership position and who does not. Leaders have to be able to delegate and manage resources wisely – including staff expertise. Shouldering more of the workload may not earn you that promotion. Instead, it may highlight your inability to delegate effectively.
　　51. What does the author say is the problem with women?
　　A) They are often unclear about the career goals to reach.
　　B) They are usually more committed at home than on the job.
　　C) They tend to be over-optimistic about how far they could go.
　　D) They tend to push themselves beyond the limits of their ability.
　　52. Why do working women of child-bearing age tend to feel drained of energy?
　　A) They struggle to satisfy the demands of both work and home.
　　B) They are too devoted to work and unable to relax as a result.
　　C) They do their best to cooperate with their workmates.
　　D) They are obliged to take up too many responsibilities.
　　53. What may hinder the future prospects of career women?
　　A) Their unwillingness to say “no”.
　　B) Their desire to be considered powerful.
　　C) An underestimate of their own ability.
　　D) A lack of courage to face challenges.
　　54. Men and woman differ in their approach to resolving workplace conflicts in that______.
　　A) women tend to be easily satisfied
　　B) men are generally more persuasive
　　C) men tend to put their personal interests first
　　D) women are much more ready to compromise
　　55. What is important to a good leader?
　　A) A dominant personality. C) The courage to admit failure
　　B) The ability to delegate. D) A strong sense of responsibility.

参考答案
Part I Writing参考范文
　　Recent years, the relationship between doctors and patients has been a heated topic. However, with the increasingly serious physician-patient relationship, it is important to find out some ways to solve the problem. Therefore, some measures mentioned below are the most important aspects that we should take into consideration.
　　On the one hand, it is indispensable that communication between doctor and patients should be strengthened due to the the fact that doctor-patient communication can be seen as a bridge of two-way communication between doctors and patients, which is beneficial for them to improve their relationship. As a matter of fact, although sometimes there are some defects in medical infrastructure, patients can make allowance for them friendly for their good relationship. On the other hand, the most important character doctor should have is professional ethics that is the foremost way to gain trust from patients.
　　All in all, it is high time that both hospitals and patients should take some steps to deal with current poor relationship. Only in this way, can we create a harmonious society.

　　Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
Why aren't you curious about what happened?
A)"you suspended ray rice after our video, a reporter from tmz challenged national football League commissioner roger goodell the other day. "why didn't you have the curosity to go to the casino ( 5 ) yourself? "the implication of the question is that a more curious.
B) the accusation of incuriosity is one that we hear often carying the suggestion that there is something wrong with not wanting to search out the truth. " have been bothered for a long time about the curious lack of curiosity, "said a democratic member of the new jersey legislature back in july, referring to an insufficiently inquiring attitude on the part of an the george washington bridge traffic scandal " the mainstream media the least curious about what happened? "wrote conservative writer jennifer rubin earlier this year terring to the attack on americans in benghazi, Libya.
C) the implication, in each case is that curiosity is a good thing, and a lack of curiosity is a problem are such accusations simply efforts to score political points for one's party? or is here something of particular value about curiosity in and of itself.
D) the journalist lan leslie. in his new and enjoyable book curious: the desire to know and whyYour fatter depends on it, insists that the answer to that last question is yes. Leslie argues that curiosity is a much-overlooked human virtue, crucial to our success, and that we are losing it.
E)we are suffering. he writes from a" deficit" the word""was coined by horace walpole in an 1854 letter from a tale of three princes whowere always making
discoveries by accident, of things they were not in search of, " worries that the rise of the intemet, among other social and technological changes, has reduced our appetite for aimless adventures no longer have we the inclination to let ourselves wander through tields of knowledges, ready to be surprised. instead, we seek only the information we want.
F) why is this a problem because without curiosity we will lose the spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship. we will see unimaginative govemments and dying corporations make disas-trous decisions.We will lose a vital part of what has made humanity as a whole so successful as a species.
G) leslie presents considerable evidence for the proposition that the society as a whole is growing less curious. In the U.S and Europe, for example, the rise of the internet has led to a declining consumption of news from outside the reader's borders .But not everything is to be blamed on techeology.The decline in interest in literary fiction is also one of the causes identified by Leslie.Reading literary fiction,he says ,make us more curious.
H)Moreover,in order to  be curious, "you have to be aware of a gap in your knowledge in the first place. "although leslie perhaps paints a bit broadly in contending that most of us are unaware of how much we don't know he's surely right to point out that the problem is growing: "Google can give us the powerful illusion that all questions have definite answers
I）Indeed, Google, for which leslie expresses admiration, is also his frequent whipping body(替罪羊). he quotes Google co-founder larry page to the effect that theperfect search engine willunderstand exactly what i mean and give me back exactly what i want "elsewhere in the book, leslie writes:"google aims to save you from the thirst of curiosity altogether.
J) Somewhat nostalgically(怀旧地). he quotes john maynard keynes's justly famous words of praise to the bookstore: "one should enter it vaguely, almost in a dream, and allow what is there freely to attract and influence the eye to walk the rounds of the bookshops, dipping curiosity dictates, should be an afternoons entertainment. "if only!
K) Citing the work of psychologists and cognitive( 认知的)scientists, leslie criticizes the re-ceived wisdom that academic success is the result of a combination of intellectual talent and hard work. curiosity, he argues, is the third key factor--and a difficult one to preserve, if not cultivated, it will not survive "childhood curiosity is a collaboration between child The surest way to kill it is to leave it alone.
L) School education, he wams, is often conducted in a way that makes children incurious chil-dren of educated and upper-middle-class parents turn out to be far more curious, even at early ages than children of working class and lower class families that lack of curiosity produces arelative lack of knowledge, and the lack of knowledge is difficult if not impossible to compen. sate for later on
M）although leslie's book isn't about politics, he doesn't entirely toast cucial moments. there are serious consequence, be ba i 2 Political leaders, like leaders of other organizations, should betheTheyare serious conesquences.he warns, in not wanting to know
N) he presents as an example the failure of the george w bush administration to prepare prop-erly for the after-effects of the invasion of iraq. according to leslie, those who ridiculed former.Defense secretary donald rumsfeld for his 2002 remark that we have to be wary of the un-known unknownswere mistaken. rumsfeld's idea leslie writes, " absurd- it was smart. "he adds, "the tragedy is that he didn't follow his own advice."
o) All of which brings us back to goodell and the christie case and benghazi. each critic in those curious. i leave it to the reader's political preference to decide which, if any charges should remaining determinedly incurious about our own. we should be delighted to pursue knowledge for its own sake--even when what we find out is something we didn't particularly want to
36. to be curious, we need to realize first of all that there are many things we dont know.
37. according to leslie, curiosity is essential to one's success.
38. we should feel happy when we pursue knowledge for knowledge's sake.
39. political leaders' lack of curiosity will result in bad consequences.
40. there are often accusations about politicians' and the media's lack of curiosity to find out the truth
41, the less curious a child is, the less knowledge the child may turn out to have.
42. it is widely accepted that academic accomplishment lies in both intelligence and diligence.
43. visiting a bookshop as curiosity leads us can be a good way to entertain ourselves.
44. both the rise of the internet and reduced appetite for literary fiction contribute to peoples declining curiosity
45. mankind wouldn't be so innovative without curosity.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage one
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage
Aging happens to all of us ,and is generylly thought of as a natural part of life. It would seem silly to call such a thing a "disease".on the other hand,scientists are increasingly learning that aging and biological age are two different things,and that the former is a key risk factor for conditions such as heart disease,cancer and many more. in that light,aging itself might be seen as something treatable, the way you would treat high blood pressure or a vitamin deficiency.
Biophysicist alex zhavoronkov believes that aging should be considered a disease. he said that describing aging as a disease creates incentives to develop treatments.
"It unties the hands of the pharmaceutical(制药的)industry so that they can begin treating the disease and not just the side effects, "he said。
"Right now, people think of aging as natural and something you can't control "he said. "in academic circles, people take aging research as just an interest area where they can try to develop interventions. the medical community also takes aging for granted, and can do nothing about it except keep people within a certain health range."
But if aging were recognized as a disease, he said, "it would attract funding and change the way we do health care. what matters is understanding that aging is curable. "
"it was always known that the body accumulates damage, "he added. "the only way to cure aging is to find ways to repair that damage. i think of it as preventive medicine for age-related conditions.
Leonard hayflick, a professor at the university of califomia, san francisco, said the idea that aging can be cured implies the human lifespan can be increased, which some researchers suggest is possible. hayflick is not among them.
" There 're many people who recover from cancer, stroke or heart disease. but they continue to age, because aging is separate from their disease, " said."even if those causes of death were eliminated, life expectancy would still not go much beyond 92 years."
46. what do people generally believe about aging?
a) it should cause no alarm whatsoever.
b)they just cannot do anything about it.
c) it should be regarded as a kind of disease
d)they can delay it with advances in science
47. how do many scientists view aging now?
a) it might be prevented and treated
c) results from a vitamin deficiency
b)it can be as risky as heart disease
d)it is an irreversible biological proces
48. what does alex zhavoronkov think ofdescribing aging as a discase?
a) it will prompt people to take aging more seriously.
b) it will greatly help reduce the side effects of aging
c) it will free pharmacists from the conventional beliefs about aging
d)it will motivate doctors and pharmacists to find ways to treat aging
49. what do we learn about the medical community?
a) they differ from the academic circles in their view on aging.
c)they can contribute to people's health only to a limited extent.
d) they have ways to intervene in people's aging process
50. what does professor leonard hayflick believe?
a)the human lifespan cannot be prolonged.
b)aging is hardly separable from disease
c) few people live up to the age of 92
d) heart disease is the major cause of aging
Passage two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage
Female applicants to postdoctoral positions in geosciences were nearly half as likely to receive excellent letters of recor ompared with their male counterparts. christopher intagliata report.
As in many other fields, gender bias is widespread in the sciences. men score higher starting salaries, have more mentoring (指导), and have better odds of being hired. studies nigher starting also perceived as more competent than women in stem(science, technology, enging,and Mathematics) fields. and new research reveals that men are more likely to receive excellent letters of 
recommendation, too.
"Say, you know, this is the best student I've ever had, "says kuheli dutt, a social scientist and diversity officer at columbia university's lamont campus. 
"compare those excellent letters with a merely good letter: 'the candidate was productive, or intelligent, or a solid scientist or something that's clearly.solid praise, 'but nothing that singles out the candidate as exceptional ot one of a kind."
Dutt and her colleagues studied more than 1,200 letters of recommendation for postdoctor at positions in geoscience.they were all edited for gender and other idetifying information,so dutt and her team could assign them a scoer without knowing the gender of the student. they found that and women, th udes letters of recommendation from all over the world, and written by, yes,he findings are in the ioumal nature geoscience.
Dutt says they were not able to evaluate the actual scientific qualificati
f the apsing the data in the files. but she says the results still suggest women in geoscience are at apotential disadvantage from the very beginning of their careers starting with those less than out-standing letters of recommendation.
3we re not trying to assign blame or criticize anyone or call anyone conscious

a)they are hardly ever supported by concrete examples.
b)they contain nothing that distinguishes the applicants
c) they provide objective information without exaggerat

　　As we widely know that the relationship between parents and children plays a significant role in the domestic relationship, which not only serves as crucial bridge to build trust and connection between two generations but also exerts a profound and subtle influence toward to children’s personal growth.
　　In order to strengthen the relationship, it is imperative to cultivate the respect between generations, which not only includes the respect to parents from children but also the other way around. Furthermore, it is sensible for the parents to spend more time on the company with their children, enhancing the affection between each other. Finally, it is wise for the parents to set an example rather than make demands, enabling the children to follow and achieve spiritual development.
　　To sum up, the sound relationship between two generations requires the integration of numerous measures derived from the joint effort of parents, children and schools.

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.

Millions die early from air pollution each year. Air pollution costs the global economy more than $5 trillion annually in welfare costs, with the most serious 26 occurring in the developing world.
The figures include a number of costs 27 with air pollution. Lost income alone amounts to $225 billion a year.
The report includes both indoor and outdoor air pollution. Indoor pollution, which includes 28 like home heating and cooking, has remained 29 over the past several decades despite advances in the area. Levels of outdoor pollution have grown rapidly along with rapid growth in industry and transportation.
Director of Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation Chris Murray 30 it as an “urgent call to action.”“One of the risk factors for premature deaths is the air we breathe, over which individuals have little 31 ,”he said.
The effects of air pollution are worst in the developing world, where in some places lost-labor income 32 nearly 1% of GDP. Around 9 in 10 people in low-and middle-income countries live in places where they 33 experience dangerous levels of outdoor air pollution.
But the problem is not limited 34 to the developing world. Thousands die prematurely in the U.S. as a result of related illnesses. In many European countries, where diesel(柴油) 35 have become more common in recent years, that number reaches tens of thousands.
A) ability                    K) regularly

Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
　            Food-as-Medicine Movement Is Witnessing Progress
[A] Several times a month, you can find a doctor in the aisles of Ralph’s market in Huntington Beach, California, wearing a white coat and helping people learn about food. On one recent day, this doctor was Daniel Nadeau, wandering the cereal aisle with Allison Scott, giving her some idea on how to feed kids who persistently avoid anything that is healthy. “Have you thought about trying fresh juices in the morning?” he asks her. “The frozen oranges and apples are a little cheaper, and fruits are really good for the brain. Juices are quick and easy to prepare, you can take the frozen fruit out the night before and have it ready the next morning.”
[B] Scott is delighted to get food advice from a physician who is program director of the nearby Mary and Dick Allen Diabetes Center, part of the St. Joseph Hoag Health alliance. The center’s ‘Shop with Your Doc’ program sends doctors to the grocery store to meet with any patients who sign up for the service, plus any other shoppers who happen to be around with questions.
[C] Nadeau notices the pre-made macaroni (通心粉)-and-cheese boxes in Scott’s shopping cart and suggests she switch to whole grain macaroni and real cheese. “So I’d have to make it?”she asks, her enthusiasm fading at the thought of how long that might take, just to have her kids reject it. “I’m not sure they’d eat it. They just won’t eat it.”
[D] Nadeau says sugar and processed foods are big contributors to the rising diabetes rates among children. “In America, over 50 percent of our food is processed food,” Nadeau tells her. “And only 5 percent of our food is plant-based food. I think we should try to reverse that.” Scott agrees to try more fruit juices for the kids and to make real macaroni and cheese. Score one point for the doctor, zero for diabetes.
[E] Nadeau is part of a small revolution developing across California. The food-as-medicine movement has been around for decades, but it’s making progress as physicians and medical institutions make food a formal part of treatment, rather than relying solely on medications (药物). By prescribing nutritional changes or launching programs such as ‘Shop with your Doc’, they are trying to prevent, limit or even reverse disease by changing what patients eat. “There’s no question people can take things a long way toward reversing diabetes, reversing high blood pressure, even preventing cancer by food choices,” Nadeau says.
[F] In the big picture, says Dr. Richard Afable, CEO and president of ST. Joseph Hoag Health, medical institutions across the state are starting to make a philosophical switch to becoming a health organization, not just a health care organization. That feeling echoes the beliefs of the Therapeutic Food Pantry program at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, which completed its pilot phase and is about to expand on an ongoing basis to five clinic sites throughout the city. The program will offer patients several bags of food prescribed for their condition, along with intensive training in how to cook it. “We really want to link food and medicine, and not just give away food,” says Dr. Rita Nguyen, the hospital’s medical director of Healthy Food Initiatives. “We want people to understand what they’re eating, how to prepare it, the role food plays in their lives.”
[G] In Southern California, Loma Linda University School of Medicine is offering specialized training for its resident physicians in Lifestyle Medicine — that is a formal specialty in using food to treat disease. Research findings increasingly show the power of food to treat or reverse diseases, but that does not mean that diet alone is always the solution, or that every illness can benefit substantially from dietary changes. Nonetheless, physicians say that they look at the collective data and a clear picture emerges: that the salt, sugar, fat and processed foods in the American diet contribute to the nation’s high rates of obesity, diabetes and heart disease. According to the World Health Organization, 80 percent of deaths from heart disease and stroke are caused by high blood pressure, tobacco use, elevated cholesterol and low consumption of fruits and vegetables.
[H] “It’s a different paradigm(范式) of how to treat disease,” says Dr. Brenda Rea, who helps run the family and preventive medicine residency program at Loma Linda University School of Medicine. The lifestyle medicine specialty is designed to train doctors in how to prevent and treat disease, in part, by changing patients’ nutritional habits. The medical center and school at Loma Linda also has a food cupboard and kitchen for patients. This way, patients not only learn about which foods to buy, but also how to prepare them at home.
[I] Many people don’t know how to cook, Rea says, and they only know how to heat things up. That means depending on packaged food with high salt and sugar content. So teaching people about which foods are healthy and how to prepare them, she says, can actually transform a patient’s life. And beyond that, it might transform the health and lives of that patient’s family. “What people eat can be medicine or poison,” Rea says. “As a physician, nutrition is one of the most powerful things you can change to reverse the effects of long-term disease.”
[J] Studies have explored evidence that dietary changes can slow inflammation(炎症), for example, or make the body inhospitable to cancer cells. In general, many lifestyle medicine physicians recommend a plant-based diet — particularly for people with diabetes or other inflammatory conditions.
[K] “As what happened with tobacco, this will require a cultural shift, but that can happen,” says Nguyen. “In the same way physicians used to smoke, and then stopped smoking and were able to talk to patients about it, I think physicians can have a bigger voice in it.”
36. More than half of the food Americans eat is factory-produced.
37. There is a special program that assigns doctors to give advice to shoppers in food stores.
38. There is growing evidence from research that food helps patients recover from various illnesses.
39. A healthy breakfast can be prepared quickly and easily.
40. Training a patient to prepare healthy food can change their life.
41. One food-as-medicine program not only prescribes food for treatment but teaches patients how to cook it.
42. Scott is not keen on cooking food herself, thinking it would simply be a waste of time.
43. Diabetes patients are advised to eat more plant-based food.
44. Using food as medicine is no novel idea, but the movement is making headway these days.
45. Americans’ high rates of various illnesses result from the way they eat.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 and 50 are based on the following passage.
California has been facing a drought for many years now, with certain areas even having to pump freshwater hundreds of miles to their distribution system. The problem is growing as the population of the state continues to expand. New research has found deep water reserves under the state which could help solve their drought crisis. Previous drilling of wells could only reach depths of 1,000 feet, but due to new pumping practices, water deeper than this can now be extracted (抽取). The team at Stanford investigated the aquifers(地下蓄水层)below this depth and found that reserves may be triple what was previously thought.
It is profitable to drill to depths more than 1,000 feet for oil and gas extraction, but only recently in California has it become profitable to pump water from this depth. The aquifers range from 1,000 to 3,000 feet below the ground, which means that pumping will be expensive and there are other concerns. The biggest concern of pumping out water from this deep in the gradual settling down of the land surface. As the water is pumped out, the vacant space left is compacted by the weight of the earth above.
Even though pumping from these depths is expensive, it is still cheaper than desalinating(脱盐)the ocean water in the largely coastal state. Some desalination plants exist where feasible, but they are costly to run and can need constant repairs. Wells are much more reliable sources of freshwater, and California is hoping that these deep wells may be the answer to their severe water shortage.
One problem with these sources is that the deep water also has a higher level of salt than shallower aquifers. This means that some wells may even need to undergo desalination after extraction, thus increasing the cost. Research from the exhaustive study of groundwater from over 950 drilling logs has just been published. New estimates of the water reserves now go up to 2,700 billion cubic meters of freshwater.
46.How could California’s drought crisis be solved according to some researchers?
A) By building more reserves of groundwater.
B) By drawing water from the depths of the earth.
C) By developing more advanced drilling devices.
D) By upgrading its water distribution system.
47.What can be inferred about extracting water from deep aquifers?
A) It was deemed vital to solving the water problem.
B) It was not considered worth the expense.
C) It may not provide quality freshwater.
D) It is bound to gain support from the local people.
48. What is mentioned as a consequence of extracting water from deep underground?
A) The sinking of land surface. C) The damage to aquifers.
B) The harm to the ecosystem. D) The change of the climate.
49. What does the author say about deep wells?
A) They run without any need for repairs.
B) They are entirely free from pollutants.
C) They are the ultimate solution to droughts.
D) They provide a steady supply of freshwater.
50. What may happen when deep aquifers are used as water sources?
A) People’s health may improve with cleaner water.
B) People’s water bills may be lowered considerably.
C) The cost may go up due to desalination.
D) They may be exhausted sooner or later.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

The AlphaGo program’s victory is an example of how smart computers have become.
But can artificial intelligence (AI) machines act ethically, meaning can they be honest and fair?
One example of AI is driverless cars. They are already on California roads, so it is not too soon to ask whether we can program a machine to act ethically. As driverless cars improve, they will save lives. They will make fewer mistakes than human drivers do. Sometimes, however, they will face a choice between lives. Should the cars be programmed to avoid hitting a child running across the road, even if that will put their passengers at risk? What about making a sudden turn to avoid a dog? What if the only risk is damage to the car itself, not to the passengers?
Perhaps there will be lessons to learn from driverless cars, but they are not super-intelligent beings. Teaching ethics to a machine even more intelligent than we are will be the bigger challenge.
About the same time as AlphaGo’s triumph, Microsoft’s ‘chatbot’ took a bad turn. The software, named Taylor, was designed to answer messages from people aged 18-24. Taylor was supposed to be able to learn from the messages she received. She was designed to slowly improve her ability to handle conversations, but some people were teaching Taylor racist ideas. When she started saying nice things about Hitler, Microsoft turned her off and deleted her ugliest messages.
AlphaGo’s victory and Taylor’s defeat happened at about the same time. This should be a warning to us. It is one thing to use AI within a game with clear rules and clear goals. It is something very different to use AI in the real world. The unpredictability of the real world may bring to the surface a troubling software problem.
Eric Schmidt is one of the bosses of Google, which own AlphoGo. He thinks AI will be positive for humans. He said people will be the winner, whatever the outcome. Advances in AI will make human beings smarter, more able and “just better human beings.”
51.What does the author want to show with the example of AlphaGo’s victory?
A)Computers will prevail over human beings.
B)Computers have unmatched potential.
C)Computers are man’s potential rivals.
D)Computers can become highly intelligent.
52.What does the author mean by AI machines acting ethically?
A)They are capable of predicting possible risks.
B)They weigh the gains and losses before reaching a decision.
C)They make sensible decisions when facing moral dilemmas.
D)They sacrifice everything to save human lives.
53.What is said to be the bigger challenge facing humans in the AI age?
A)How to make super-intelligent AI machines share human feelings.
B)How to ensure that super-intelligent AI machines act ethically.
C)How to prevent AI machines doing harm to humans.
D)How to avoid being over-dependent on AI machines.
54.What do we learn about Microsoft’s “chatbot” Taylor?
A)She could not distinguish good from bad.
B)She could turn herself off when necessary.
C)She was not made to handle novel situations.
D)She was good at performing routine tasks.
55. What does Eric Schmidt think of artificial intelligence?
A) It will be far superior to human beings.
B) It will keep improving as time goes by.
C) It will prove to be an asset to human beings.
D) It will be here to stay whatever the outcome.

Part Ⅲ           Reading Comprehension            ( 40 minutes )
Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.

Have you ever used email to apologize to a colleague? Delivered a    26    to a subordinate (下属) with a voice-mail message? Flown by plane across the country just to deliver important news in person? The various communication options at our fingertips today can be good for    27    and productivity—and at the same time very troublesome. With so many ways to communicate, how should a manager choose the one that's best—   28    when the message to be delivered is bad or unwelcome news for the recipient? We've    29    business communication consultants and etiquette (礼仪) experts to come up with the following guidelines for    30    using the alternative ways of delivering difficult messages.
First of all, choose how personal you want to be. A face-to-face communication is the most    31   . Other choices, in descending order of personalization, are: a real-time phone call, a voice-mail message, a handwritten note, a typewritten letter, and the most    32    is email. Some of these may change order according to the    33    situation or your own preferences; for example, a handwritten note might seem more personal than voice-mail. How do you decide on the best choice for the difficult message you've got to deliver? “My    34    concern is: How can I soften or civilize this message?” says etiquette expert Dana Casperson. “So when I apologize, I usually choose in-person first, or a phone conversation as my top alternative, and maybe a handwritten note next. Apologizing by email is something I now totally    35   .”
A) avoid                    I) reward
B) convenience               J) silent 
C) effectively                
D) escape                   K) specific       
E) intimate                  L) surveyed          
F) particularly               M) unfriendly
G) primary                  N) warning
H) prompt                  O) witnessed

Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
　           How a Poor, Abandoned Parisian Boy Became a Top Chef
A) The busy streets in Paris were uneven and caked in thick mud, but there was always a breathtaking sight to see in the shop windows of Patisserie de la Rue de la Paix. By 1814, people crowded outside the bakery, straining for a glimpse of the latest sweet food created by the young chef who worked inside.
B)His name was Marie-Antoine Carême, and he had appeared, one day, almost out of nowhere. But in his short lifetime, which ended exactly 184 years ago today, he would forever revolutionize French gourmet food （美食）, write best-selling cook books and think up magical dishes for royals and other important people.
C)Carême's childhood was one part tragedy, equal part mystery. Born the 16th child to poor parents in Paris in either 1783 or 1784, a young Carême was suddenly abandoned at the height of the French Revolution. At 8 years old, he worked as a kitchen boy for a restaurant in Paris in exchange for room and board. By age 15, he had become an apprentice （学徒） to Sylvain Bailly, a well-known dessert chef with a successful bakery in one of Paris's most fashionable neighborhoods.
D)Carême was quick at learning in the kitchen. Bailly encouraged his young apprentice to learn to read and write. Carême would often spend his free afternoons at the nearby National Library reading books on art and architecture. In the back room of the little bakery, his interest in design and his baking talent combined to work wonders—he shaped delicious masterpieces out of flour, butter and sugar.
E)In his teenage years, Carême fashioned eatable copies of the late 18th century's most famous buildings—cookies in the shape of ruins of ancient Athens and pies in the shape of ancient Chinese palaces and temples. Sylvain Bailly, his master, displayed these luxuriant creations—often as large as 4 feet tall—in his bakery windows.
F)Carême's creations soon captured the discriminating eye of a French diplomat, Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord. Around 1804, Talleyrand challenged Carême to produce a full menu for his personal castle, instructing the young baker to use local, seasonal fruits and vegetables and to avoid repeating main dishes over the course of an entire year. The experiment was a grand success and Talleyrand's association with French nobility would prove a profitable connection for Carême.
G) French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte was known to be unimpressed by the declining taste of early 18th century cooking, but under pressure to entertain Paris's high society, he too called Carême to his kitchen at Tuileries Palace. In 1810, Carême designed the extraordinary cake for the wedding of Napoleon and his second bride, Marie-Louise of Austria. He became one of the first modern chefs to focus on the appearance of his table, not just the flavor of his dishes. “I want order and taste. A well-displayed meal is enhanced one hundred percent in my eyes,” he later wrote in one of his cook books.
H)In 1816, Carême began a culinary (烹饪的) journey which would forever mark his place as history's first top chef. He voyaged to England to cook in the modern Great Kitchen of the prince regent (摄政王)， George Ⅳ, and crossed continents to prepare grand banquets for the tables of Tsar Alexander Ⅰ of Russia. Never afraid to talk up his own accomplishments, a boastful Carême made a fortune as wealthy families with social ambitions invited him to their kitchens. Later, in his cook books, he would often include a sketch of himself, so that people on the street would be able to recognize—and admire—him.
I)Carême's cooking displays became the symbol of fine French dining; they were plentiful, beautiful and imposing. Guests would fall silent in wonder as servants carried Carême's fancy creations into the dining hall. For a banquet celebrating the Grand Duke Nicholas of Russia's visit to George Ⅳ's Brighton Pavillion on Jan. 18, 1817, the menu featured 120 different dishes, highlighting eight different soups, 40 main courses, and 32 desserts.
J)As he traveled through the homes of early 19th century nobility, Carême forged the new art of French gourmet food. Locked in hot kitchens, Carême created his four “mother sauces.” These sauces—béchamel, velouté, espagnole and allemande—formed the central building blocks for many French main courses. He also perfected the soufflé—a baked egg dish, and introduced the standard chef's uniform—the same double-breasted white coat and tall white hat still worn by many chefs today. The white clothing conveyed an image of cleanliness, according to Carême—and in his realm, appearance was everything.
K)Between meals, Carême wrote cook books that would be used in European kitchens for the next century. His manuals including The Royal Parisian Baker and the massive five-volume Art of French Cooking Series (1833-1847, completed after his death) first systematized many basic principles of cooking, complete with drawings and step-by-step directions. Long before television cooking shows, Carême walked readers through common kitchen tasks, instructing them to “try this for yourself, at home” as famous American Chef Julia Child might do, many years later.
L）In the end, however， it was the kitchen that did Carême in. Decades of working over coal fires in tight, closed spaces with little fresh air (to ensure his dishes would not get cold) had fatally damaged his lungs. On Jan. 12, 1833, Carême died just before he turned 50.
M）But in his lifetime, Carême, ever confident, could see beyond his short domination in the kitchen. He wanted to “set the standard for beauty in classical and modern cooking, and prove to the distant future that the French chefs of the 19th century were the most famous in the world,” as he wrote in his papers.
N）Decades later, chef Auguste Escoffier would build upon Carême's concept of French cuisine （烹饪）. But in the very beginning, there was just Carême, the top chef who elevated dining into art.
36. Carême was among the first chefs who stressed both the appearance and flavor of dishes.
37. Carême wanted to show to later generations that French chefs of his time were most outstanding in the world.
38. Carême benefited greatly from serving a French diplomat and his connections.
39. Carême learned his trade from a famous dessert chef in Paris.
40. Carême's creative works were exhibited in the shop windows by his master.
41. Carême's knowledge of art and architecture helped him create extraordinary desserts out of ordinary ingredients.
42. Many people in Paris were eager to have a look at the latest sweet food made by Carême.
43. Carême became extremely wealthy by cooking for rich and socially ambitious families.
44. Carême's writings dealt with fundamental cooking principles in a systematic way.
45. Carême's contribution to French cooking was revolutionary.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 and 50 are based on the following passage.
Roughly the size of a soda can, sitting on a bookshelf, a relatively harmless gadget may be turning friends away from your home. The elephant in your living room is your Internet-connected security camera, a device people are increasingly using for peace of mind in their homes. But few stop to think about the effect these devices may have on house guests. Should you tell your friends, for instance, that they're being recorded while you all watch the big game together?
 “It's certainly new territory, especially as home security cameras become easier to install,” says Lizzie Post, president of the Emily Post Institute, America's foremost manners advisors. “I think it will be very interesting to see what etiquette （礼仪） emerges in terms of whether you tell people you have a camera or not, and whether guests have a right to ask that it be turned off, if it's not a security issue.”
 Post wants to make clear that she's not talking about legal rights, but rather personal preferenc. She also wants to explain that there are no right or wrong answers regarding manners on this front yet, because the technology is just now becoming mainstream. Besides, the Emily Post Institute doesn't dictate manners.
 When it comes to security cameras, Post says it's a host's responsibility to make sure guests feel comfortable within their home. “I'm always a fan of being open and honest.” For instance, if the host casually acknowledges that there is a camera in the room by telling a story about it, that may be enough to provide an opening for a guest to say if they are uncomfortable.
However, if a contractor is working in your home, you don't need to tell them that there are cameras watching. Then again, the air of accountability that the camera generates can also work in contractors' favor. “If anything does go wrong while they're in the house, they don't want to be blamed for it,” she says. “In fact, the camera could be the thing that proves that they didn't steal the $20, or knock the vase off the table.”
46.For what reason may your friends feel reluctant to visit your home?
A) The security camera installed may intrude into their privacy.
B) They don’t want their photos to be circulated on the Internet.
C) The security camera may turn out to be harmful to their health.
D) They may not be willing to interact with your family members.
47.What does Lizzie Post say is new territory?
A) The effect of manners advice on the public.
B) Cost of applying new technologies at home.
C) The increasing use of home security devices.
D) Etiquette around home security cameras.
48. What is Lizzie Post mainly discussing with regard to the use of home security cameras?
A) Legal rights.				C) Likes and dislikes of individuals.
B)Moral issues				D) The possible impact on manners.
49. What is a host’s responsibility regarding security cameras, according to Lizzie Post?
A) Making their guests feel at ease.
B) Indicating where they are.
C) Turning them off in time.
D) Ensuring their guests’ privacy.
50. In what way can the home security camera benefit visitors to your home?
A) It can satisfy their curiosity.
B) It can prove their innocence.
C) It can help them learn new technology.
D) It can make their visit more enjoyable.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

PepsiCo is to spend billions of dollars to develop drinks and snacks and reformulate existing ones with lower sugar, salt and fat, as consumers demand healthier options and regulatory pressure intensifies amid an obesity epidemic （流行病）.
The maker of Mountain Dew and Gatorade has been one of the earlier movers in the industry to offer products with reduced levels of unhealthy ingredients—PepsiCo claims a packet of its chips now contains less salt than a slice of white bread. However, its new 10-year plan makes clear it believes it still has a long way to go.
Shifting eating habits, including a sharp drop in consumption of sparkling drinks, have forced radical change on the industry. But those shifts have yet to be reflected in record obesity levels, which stand at 36.5% overall in the US.
Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo chairman, said the plan to make its products healthier was important for the company's growth. But on the subject of obesity, she pointed out that consumers’ lifestyles have changed significantly, with many people being more sedentary （久坐不动的） not least because more time is spent in front of computers. She said PepsiCo's contribution was to produce healthier snacks that still tasted good.
“Society has to change its habits,” she added. “We can't do much to alter sedentary lifestyles, but we can provide consumers with great-tasting products, low in salt, sugar and fat. In the past we had to have a taste trade-off. But we're breaking that trade-off.”
PepsiCo's plan for its foods and drinks is based on guidelines from the World Health Organisation, which last week backed using taxes on sparkling drinks to reduce sugar consumption. Initiatives also include efforts to reduce its environmental impact, water consumption and materials used in packaging by 2025.
PepsiCo did not say exactly how much it planned to invest to reach its goals. However, Dr Mehmood Khan, chief scientific officer, said the company had doubled research and development spending in the past five years and was “committed to sustaining investment”, adding that companies cannot cost-cut their way to increasing sales.  PepsiCo's research and development budget in 2015 was $754 million.
51.Why is PepsiCo making a policy change?
A) To win support from the federal government.
B) To be more competitive in the global market.
C) To satisfy the growing needs for healthy foods.
D) To invest more wisely in the soft drink industry.
52. What does PepsiCo think it will have to do in the future?
A) Invest more to develop new snacks.
B) Reduce levels of obesity in the US.
C) Change consumers’ eating habits.
D) Keep on improving its products.
53. Why does PepsiCo plan to alter its products, according to Indra Nooyi?
A) To ensure the company’s future development.
B) To adapt to its customers’ changed taste.
C) To help improve its consumers’ lifestyles.
D) To break the trade-off in its product design.
54. What does Indra Nooyi say about the obesity epidemic?
A) It is mainly caused by overconsumption of snacks.
B) It results from high sugar and salt consumption.
C) It is attributable to people’s changed lifestyles.
D) It has a lot to do with longer working hours.
55. What has PepsiCo been doing to achieve its objective?
A) Studying WHO’s guidelines.			B) Increasing its research funding.
C) Expanding its market overseas.			D) Cutting its production costs.

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.

A few months ago, I was down with a terrible cold which ended in a persistent bad cough. No matter how many different  26  I tried, I still couldn’t get rid of the cough. Not only did it  27  my teaching but also my life as a whole. Then one day after class, a student came up to me and  28  traditional Chinese medicine. From her description, Chinese medicine sounded as if it had magic power that worked wonders. I was  29  because I knew so little about it and have never it before. Eventually, my cough got so much  30  that I couldn’t sleep at night, so I decided to give it a try. The Chinese doctor took my pulse and asked to see my tongue, both of which were new  31  to me because they are both non-existent in Western medicine. Then the doctor gave me a scraping（刮）treatment known as “Gua Sha”.  I was a little  32  at first because he used a smooth edged tool to scrape the skin on my neck and shoulders. A few minutes later, the  33  strokes started to produce a relieving effect and my body and mind began to  34  deeper into relaxation. I didn’t feel any improvement in my condition in the first couple of days, but after a few more regular visits to the doctor, my cough started to  35  . Then, within a matter of weeks, it was completely gone!
A) deepen                    I)remedies

Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
　           How a Poor, Abandoned Parisian Boy Became a Top Chef
A) When you drop a piece of food on the floor, is it really OK to eat if you pick it up within five seconds? An urban food myth contends that if food spends just a few seconds on the floor, dirt and germs won’t have much of a chance to contaminate it. Research in my lab has focused on how food becomes contaminated, and we’ve done some work on this particular piece of wisdom.
B) While the “five-second rule” might not seem like the most pressing issue for food scientists to get to the bottom of, it’s still worth investigating food myths like this one because they shape our beliefs about when food is safe to eat.
C) So is five seconds on the floor the critical threshold（门槛）that separates a piece of eatable food from a case of food poisoning? It’s a bit more complicated than that. It depends on just how many bacteria can make it from floor to food in a few seconds and just how dirty the floor is.
D) Wondering if food is still OK to eat after it’s dropped on the floor is a pretty common experience. And it’s probably not a new one either. A well-known, but inaccurate, story about Julia Child may have contributed to this food myth. Some viewers of her cooking show, The French Chef, insist they saw Child drop lamb on the floor and pick it up, with the advice that if they were alone in the kitchen, their guests would never know.
E) In fact it was a potato pancake, and it fell on the stovetop, not on the floor. Child put it back in the pan, saying, “But you can always pick it up and if you’re alone in the kitchen, who’s going to see it?” But the misremembered story persists. It’s harder to pin down the origins of the oft-quoted five-second rule, but a 2003 study reported that 70% of women and 56% of men surveyed were familiar with the five-second rule and that women were more likely than men to eat food that had dropped on the floor.
F) So what does science tell us about what a few moments on the floor means for the safety of your food? The earliest research report on the five-second rule is attributed to Jillian Clarke, a high school student participating in a research project at the University of Illinois. Clarke and her colleagues introduced bacteria to floor tiles（瓷砖）and then placed cookies on the tiles for varying times. They reported bacteria were transferred from the tiles to the cookies within five seconds, but didn’t report the specific amount of bacteria that made it from the tiles to the food.
G) But how many bacteria actually transfer in five seconds? In 2007, my lab at Clemson University published a study in the Journal of Applied Microbiology. We wanted to know if the length of time food is in contact with a contaminated surface affected the rate of transfer of bacteria to the food. To find out, we introduced bacteria to squares of tile, carpet or wood. Five minutes after that, we placed either bacon or bread on the surface for 5,30 or 60 seconds, and then measured the number of bacteria transferred to the food. We repeated this exact procedure after the bacteria had been on the surface for 2,4,8 and 24 hours.
H) We found that the number of bacteria transferred to either kind of food didn’t depend much on how long the food was in contact with the contaminated surface—whether for a few seconds or for a whole minute. The overall number of bacteria on the surface mattered more, and this decreased over time after the initial introduction. It looks like what’s at issue is less how long your food stays on the floor and much more how contaminated with bacteria that patch of floor happens to be.
I) We also found that the kind of surface made a difference as well. Carpets, for instance, seem to be slightly better places to drop your food than wood or tile. When a carpet was contaminated, less than 1% of the bacteria were transferred. But when the food was in contact with tile or wood, 45-70% of bacteria were.
J) Last year, a study from Aston University in the UK used nearly identical parameters（参数）to our study and found similar results. They also reported that 87% of people asked either would eat or had eaten food fallen on the floor.
K) Should you eat food fallen on the floor then? From a food safety standpoint, if you have millions or more bacteria on a surface, 0.1% is still enough to make you sick. Also, certain types of bacteria are extremely harmful, and it takes only a small number to make you sick. For example, 10 bacteria or less of an especially deadly strain of bacteria can cause severe illness and death in people with compromised immune systems. But the chance of these bacteria being on most surfaces is very low.
L）And it’s not just dropping food on the floor that can lead to bacterial contamination. Bacteria are carried by various “media”, which can include raw food, moist surfaces where bacteria have been left, our hands or skin and from coughing or sneezing（打喷嚏）. Hands, foods and utensils（器皿）can carry individual bacteria living in communities contained within a protective film. These microscopic layers of deposits containing bacteria are known as biofilms and they are found on most surfaces and objects. Biofilm communities can harbor bacteria longer and are very difficult to clean. Becteria in these communities also have an enhanced resistance to sanitizers（清洁剂）and antibiotics compared to bacteria living on their own.
M）So the next time you consider eating fallen food, the odds are in your favor that you can eat it without getting sick. But in the rare chance that there is a micro-organism that there is a micro-organism that can make you sick on the exact spot where the food dropped, you can be fairly sure that the bug is on the food you are about to put in your mouth.
N）Research or common sense tells us that the best thing to do is keep your hands, utensils and other surfaces clean.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 and 50 are based on the following passage.
The latest in cat research reveals that the lovely animal seems to have a basic grasp on both the laws of physics and the ins and outs of cause and effect.
According to a newly published study, cats seem to be able to predict the location of hiding prey（猎物）using both their ears and an inborn（天生的）understanding of how the physical world works. 
In a recent experiment, Japanese researchers taped 30 domestic cats reacting to a container that a team member shook. Some containers rattled（发出响声）；others did not. When the container was tipped over, sometimes an object fell out and sometimes it didn’t.
It turns out that the cats were remarkably smart about what would happen when a container was tipped over. When an object did not drop out of the bottom of a rattling container, they looked at it for a longer time than they did when the container behaved as expected.
“Cats use a causal-logical understanding of noise or sounds to predict the appearance of invisible objects,” lead researcher Saho Takagi says in a press release. The researchers conclude that cats’ hunting style may have developed based on their common-sense abilities to infer where prey is, using their hearing.
Scientists have explored this idea with other endearing creatures: babies. Like cats, babies appear to engage in what’s called “preferential looking”—looking longer at things that are interesting or unusual than things they perceive as normal.
When babies’ expectations are violated in experiments like the ones performed with the cats, they react much like their animal friends. Psychologists have shown that babies apparently expect their world to comply with the laws of physics and cause and effect as early as two months of age.
Does the study mean that cats will soon grasp the ins and outs of cause and effect? Maybe. Okay, so cats may not be the next physics faculty members at America’s most important research universities. But by demonstrating their common sense, they’ve shown that the divide between cats and humans may not be that great after all.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

Imagine you enter a car with no steering wheel, no brake or accelerator padals（踏板）. Under a voice-activated command, you say an address. “The fastest route will take us 15.3 minutes. Should I take it?” You say “yes” and you are on your way. The car responds and starts moving all by itself. All you have to do is sit back and relax.
How weird would it be if, one day in the future, everyone had such a car? No crazy driving, no insults, no cutting in; traffic laws would be respected and driving much safer. On the other hand, imagine the cost savings for local police enforcement and town budgets without all those speeding and parking tickets.
A new technology has the potential to change modern society in radical ways. There’s no question that self-driving vehicles could be an enormous benefit. The potential for safer cars means accident statistics would drop: some 94% of road accidents in the U.S. involve human error. Older drivers and visually-or physically-impaired people would gain a new level of freedom. Maintaining safe speeds and being electric, self-driving cars would drastically reduce pollution levels and dependency on non-renewable fuels. Roads would be quieter, people safer.
But we must also consider the impact of the new technology on those who now depend on driving for their livelihoods. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, in May 2015 there were 505,560 registered school bus drivers. The American Trucking Association lists approximately 3.5 million professional truck drivers in the U.S.
The companies developing self-driving vehicles should be partnering with state and federal authorities to offer retraining for this massive workforce, many of whom will be displaced by the new technology. This is similar to what’s happening in the coal and oil industries, a situation that fuels much of the current political discontent in this country.
New technologies will, and should, be developed. This is how society moves forward. However, progress can’t be one-sided. It is necessary for the companies and state agencies involved to consider the ethical consequences of these potential changes to build a better future for all.
51.What would be the impact of the extensive use of driverless cars?
A) People would be driving in a more civilized way.
B) It would save local governments a lot of money.
C) More policemen would be patrolling the streets.
D) Traffic regulations would be a thing of the past.
52. How would the elderly and the disabled benefit from driverless cars?
A) They could enjoy greater mobility.
B) They would suffer no road accidents.
C) They would have no trouble driving.
D) They could go anywhere they want.
53. What would be the negative impact of driverless cars?
A) The conflict between labor and management would intensify.
B) The gap between various sectors of society would be widened.
C) Professional drivers would have a hard time adapting to new road conditions.
D) Numerous professional drivers would have to find new ways of earning a living.
54. What is the result of the introduction of new technologies in energy industries?
A) Political dissatisfaction.
B) Retraining of employees.
C) Fossil fuel conservation.
D) Business restructuring.
55. What does the author suggest businesses and the government do?
